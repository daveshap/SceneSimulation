Aleksy kneels on the ground, his head in his hands, trying to make sense of what has happened. He is clearly distressed, and the sun doesn't offer any respite from the heat. He looks up as a gust of wind kicks up a cloud of dust, making him squint and shield his eyes. As the dust clears, he sees a figure walking towards him. Aleksy squints, trying to make out who it is, and as the figure gets closer, he realizes it is a woman. She is wearing a long, flowing dress and a scarf over her head. Aleksy stands up, wave his arms, and shouts for help. The woman keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to him. He shouts again, and she finally acknowledges him. She speaks in a language he does not understand, and he responds in English. They stand there for a moment, looking at each other confused, before the woman turns and starts walking away. Aleksy watches her go, before collapsing to the ground again, overcome with despair.
