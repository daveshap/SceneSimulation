Aleksy's wife was still shaking, but she was able to tell him what happened. She had been in the backyard with the kids, playing fetch with the dog, when she saw the snake slithering towards them. She yelled at the kids to come to her, but they were too far away. She tried to scare the snake away, but it just kept coming closer. She was terrified and didn't know what to do. That's when she called Aleksy. He reassured her that he was on his way and that everything would be okay. When he arrived, he could see the fear in her eyes. He slowly approached the snake, careful not to make any sudden moves. His wife was still terrified, but Aleksy did his best to calm her down. He slowly inched closer to the snake, then grabbed it behind the head. He carefully pulled it away from his wife and kids, then threw it as far away from them as he could. Aleksy's wife collapsed into his arms, relieved and grateful that he had arrived when he did. They both knew that it could have ended much worse if Aleksy hadn't been there.
