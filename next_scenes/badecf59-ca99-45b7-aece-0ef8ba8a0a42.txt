Mashawn climbs down the mountain, his heart still pounding in his chest. He takes each step carefully, making sure not to slip on the loose rocks. He knows it won't be long before the sun sets and the temperature starts to drop, so he wants to make it down as quickly as possible. He finally reaches the bottom and lets out a sigh of relief. He's tired, but he's happy to have made it down safely. He looks up at the mountain one last time before making his way back to camp.
