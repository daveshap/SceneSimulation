Bob closes up shop around midnight, and the last of the night shift workers head home. Bob is tired, but he's happy with how the night went. He's made some new friends, and he's glad he was able to provide a place for them to relax and chat. Bob locks up the shop and heads home. He's looking forward to getting some sleep so he can be fresh for tomorrow's coffee shop crowd.
