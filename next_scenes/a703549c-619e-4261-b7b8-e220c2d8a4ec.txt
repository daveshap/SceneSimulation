Jenna's phone suddenly vibrates, and she sees that she has a new text message. She opens it and reads the message, her eyes widening in surprise. It's from her best friend, Emily, and it says that she's just seen Jenna's ex-boyfriend, Luke, kissing another girl. Jenna can't believe it - she thought that they were still on good terms after their break-up. She feels her heart start to race and her stomach drop as she realizes that she's still not over Luke. Jenna quickly grabs her things and heads for the door, not even stopping to say goodbye to her co-workers. She knows that she needs to get out of there before she starts to cry. She rushes out of the office and down the street, trying to get as far away from the scene of the betrayal as possible.
