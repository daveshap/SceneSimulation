The noise grows louder and Swathi finally notices it. She gets up from her desk and walks to the window to see what is going on. She sees a group of people in the street below, screaming and shouting. Some of them are holding signs and waving them in the air. Others are chanting and shouting slogans. Swathi is confused and doesn't know what to do. She realizes that there is a protest going on. She watches for a while, and then goes back to her desk. She tries to concentrate on her work, but the noise is too loud. After a while, she gives up and decides to go home.
