Bob finishes brewing the coffee and starts chatting with his customers as they come in and out. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed, and the rich smell of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. Bob is busy preparing for the evening rush, grinding beans and brewing coffee. In the distance, a herd of elephants can be seen grazing peacefully. The sun is setting over the savanna, casting a warm glow over the landscape.
