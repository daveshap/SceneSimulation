Swathi walked along the promenade, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. She could hear the faint strains of music coming from somewhere nearby, and she could see couples strolling hand in hand. The air was crisp and fresh, and the stars were beginning to come out. As she got closer to the tower, Swathi could see that it was even more impressive than she'd imagined. She snapped some photos on her phone, then stood there for a moment, just taking it all in. Finally, she turned to walk back to her hotel. She knew she'd never forget this night.
