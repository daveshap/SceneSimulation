Wang watches as the cab drives away with Sophie inside. He feels good that he was able to help her and hopes that she will be okay. He then begins to walk back to his own car, but he is stopped by a voice. He turns to see a man walking towards him. The man looks angry and is carrying a baseball bat. He demands to know what Wang was doing with Sophie. Wang tries to explain that he was just helping her, but the man doesn't believe him. He accuses Wang of being a creep and trying to take advantage of Sophie. The man then raises the bat and prepares to swing at Wang. Wang is terrified and does not know what to do.
