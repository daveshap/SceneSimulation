Aleksy is still in shock as he hears the sound of sirens approaching. He knows that the police will be here soon, but he feels like he can't move. He can only stand there and stare at the bodies of the people who were killed. He can't believe what he just witnessed. It feels like a nightmare, but he knows it is all too real. The sirens get louder and Aleksy can see the flashing lights of the police cars as they pull into the parking lot. He knows he should do something, but he feels like he is frozen in place. The police jump out of their cars and start running towards the store. Aleksy can see them shouting and gesturing for him to come out. He knows he should go to them, but he can't make his legs move. He feels like he is in a dream. The police are getting closer and Aleksy can see the looks of concern on their faces. They are almost to the store now, and Aleksy knows he has to do something. He forces himself to move, and he runs towards the police. He can hear them shouting at him to get down, but he doesn't know what to do. He feels like he is in a trance as he watches the police take aim and fire at him. He doesn't feel the bullets as they enter his body, and he doesn't hear the sound of the shots. He only hears the sound of his own heartbeat as he falls to the ground.
