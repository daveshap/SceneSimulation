Aleksy was just finishing up sweeping the floors when he heard a loud commotion coming from outside. He quickly put the broom away and went to peek out the window. When he looked outside, he saw a group of people walking quickly down the street towards his store. He immediately turned off the lights in the store and rushed into the back room, hoping they wouldn't see him. He could hear them now, shouting and smashing things as they came closer. He hid under the desk in the back room and waited, his heart racing in his chest. The door to the store suddenly burst open and he could hear them walking around, smashing things and throwing things. He was petrified that they would find him, but he didn't dare move. After what felt like forever, they finally left and he slowly emerged from his hiding spot. The store was a total mess, with broken glass everywhere and items thrown all over the place. Aleksy sighed in relief and started to clean up the mess, trying to forget the terrifying experience.
