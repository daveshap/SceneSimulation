Sandy walks back to the hotel, her feet dragging a little bit. She's not used to being up so early, and she knows her family will be up soon. She knows she needs to get them up and moving, but she can't help but feel a little bit exhausted. When she gets back to the room, she finds her husband and two young children still sound asleep. She smiles and shakes her head, before heading over to the window to open the curtains. The light from outside fills the room, and Sandy can hear the sounds of the city starting to come to life all around her - cars honking, people talking, and the sound of a distant siren. The sound of the siren gets louder and Sandy realizes it's coming from right outside the hotel. She looks out the window and sees a fire truck speeding down the street, its lights flashing and its siren blaring. Sandy watches it for a moment, before turning back to her family. She knows they need to get up and start their day, but she can't help but feel a little bit shaken by what she's just seen.
