Bob slowly opens his eyes and looks around his bedroom. He sees the piles of clothes on the floor and the unmade bed. He knows he needs to get up and start his day, but he can't seem to muster the energy. He looks at the clock and sees that it is already 2pm. He needs to get moving if he wants to get to the store before it closes. He slowly gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom. He turns on the shower and steps in. The hot water feels good on his tired muscles. He washes quickly and then gets out. He dries off and puts on his clothes. He looks in the mirror and sees the tired look in his eyes. He knows he needs to get some sleep soon. He leaves his bedroom and heads to the living room. He sees his cat sleeping on the couch. He knows he needs to feed her and give her some attention. He scratches her head and she starts to purr. He smiled and continues to the kitchen. He grabs a cup of coffee and heads to his shop. He knows he needs to get some work done before he can talk to his customers. He starts to sweep the floor and then dusts the shelves. He straightens up the chairs and tables. He looks at the clock and sees that it is already 4pm. He knows he needs to hurry if he wants to talk to his customers before they leave. He walks to the front of the shop and opens the door. He sees a few people sitting at the tables. He walks over to the first table and greets the customer. He asks them how their day is going and if they need anything. He then walks to the next table and does the same. He continues this until he has talked to all of his customers. He looks at the clock and sees that it is already 6pm. He knows he needs to get ready to close up shop. He walks to the back of the shop and starts to clean up. He wipes down the counters and sweeps the floors. He turns off the lights and locks the door. He walks home and feels the tiredness start to set in. He knows he needs to get some sleep so he can be rested for tomorrow.
