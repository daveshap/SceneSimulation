Mashawn is working diligently when he suddenly hears a faint scream coming from the street below. He looks down and sees a woman being mugged. He does not hesitate to jump into action. He climbs down the crane as quickly as he can and jumps to the ground, running to the woman's aid. He tackles the mugger and punches him repeatedly until he is unconscious. The woman is crying and shaking, and Mashawn comforts her until the police arrive.
