Tom quickly stuffs the camera back in its case and begins the long trek down the mountain. His fingers are still numb from the cold, and he can't feel his toes. He's grateful for the extra pair of socks he put on this morning. The sun is high in the sky now, and the mountaintops are shining brightly. Tom stops to take a few more pictures on the way down. He knows he won't be able to capture the beauty of this place with just a few photos, but he's determined to try. It's going to be a long hike down, but Tom knows it will be worth it.
