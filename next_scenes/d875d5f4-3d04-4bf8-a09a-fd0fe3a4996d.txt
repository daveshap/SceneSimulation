Mashawn finishes his lunch and throws away his garbage. He sits at his desk for a few more minutes, looking out the window and enjoying the view. After a few minutes, he gets up from his desk and stretches. He walks over to the window and looks out at the construction site. He can see the workers are still busy. He watches them for a few minutes and then turns and walks back to his desk. He sits down and starts to work on his computer.
