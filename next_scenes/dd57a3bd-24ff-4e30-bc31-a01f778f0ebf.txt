Jenna and her father chatted in the living room for a while, catching up on each other's days. Jenna told her father about her walk, and he listened intently, asking her questions about the things she had seen and heard. After a while, Jenna's mother called them into the kitchen for dessert. Jenna and her father went to the kitchen, where they found a fresh pie cooling on the counter. Jenna's mother served them each a slice of pie, and they all sat down at the table to enjoy it. Jenna and her father chatted some more while they ate, and then they all decided to go for a walk together. They stepped outside and enjoyed the rest of the afternoon together, taking in the sights and sounds of nature.
