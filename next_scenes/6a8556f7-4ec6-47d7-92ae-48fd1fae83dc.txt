Wang watches as the group approaches the Eiffel Tower. They start to climb the metal stairs, and he can see the fatigue in their movements. They're moving slowly, but they're still making progress. He hopes that they'll be able to make it to the top before nightfall. Suddenly, he hears shouting from below. He looks down and sees a group of security guards racing towards the tower. They're yelling at the group to come down, but it's too late. The group is already halfway up. The guards start to climb after them, but they're not moving very fast. Wang knows that the group won't be able to make it to the top before the guards catch them. He has to do something. He looks around and his eyes fall on a nearby construction site. He has an idea. He rushes over to the site and starts climbing the scaffolding. It's not easy, but he's motivated by the thought of the group being caught. He reaches the top of the scaffolding and looks over at the Eiffel Tower. The group is about two-thirds of the way up, but the guards are getting closer. Wang knows he has to act fast. He takes a running jump and grabs onto the edge of the platform. He swings his legs up and over, and then he's on the platform. He's breathing hard, but he's not done yet. He starts to climb the stairs, taking them two at a time. He can hear the guards below, but he doesn't look back. He knows he has to reach the group before they're caught. Finally, he reaches the top. He's just in time to see the group reach the platform. They collapse onto the floor, exhausted. The guards are right behind them, but they can't do anything now. Wang walks over to the group and offers them a hand. They look at him in disbelief, but they take his hand and start to stand up. They're safe now.
