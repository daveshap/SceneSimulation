Swathi finishes dusting her windowsill and looks around her bedroom with a satisfied feeling. She's glad she took a break from work to tidy up a bit. Suddenly, she hears her phone ringing from her desk. She walks over and sees that it's her boss calling. She answers, and her boss starts berating her for taking a break when she should be working. Swathi tries to explain that she was just taking a quick break to dust her bedroom, but her boss doesn't want to hear it. He yells at her for slacking off and tells her to get back to work. Swathi hangs up the phone, feeling upset and frustrated. She knows she shouldn't have taken a break when she's supposed to be working, but she doesn't want to let her own personal space go to waste either. She looks around her bedroom and decides that she'll tidy up a bit more later. For now, she'll just have to focus on work.
