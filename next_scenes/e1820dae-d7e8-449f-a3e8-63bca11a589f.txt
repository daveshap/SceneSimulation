The men approached Jenna and the girl, their faces illuminated by the torchlight. Jenna could see the cold, callous looks in their eyes and she knew they were in trouble. One of the men grabbed the girl and shoved her towards Jenna, while the other man pulled out a knife. He held it up to Jenna's throat and ordered her to hand over the torch. Jenna did as she was ordered, her heart pounding in her chest. The man with the knife then grabbed Jenna and pulled her towards the back of the cave, while the other man took the torch and led the way. Jenna could hear the girl crying as she was led away, and she knew there was nothing she could do to help her. She was terrified and didn't know what was going to happen to her. The man with the knife pushed her into a small room at the back of the cave and ordered her to sit down. Jenna did as she was told, her mind racing. She was trying to think of a way to escape, but she was so scared she couldn't think straight. The man then tied her hands and feet and left the room, locking the door behind him. Jenna was alone in the dark, her heart pounding, waiting for the man to come back.
