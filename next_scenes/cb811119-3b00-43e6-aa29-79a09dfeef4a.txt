Bob hurried out from behind the counter when he saw the commotion, his heart pounding as he worried someone might be hurt. He was relieved to find that the crowd was simply gathered around a woman who was pregnant and about to give birth. He and a group of bystanders helped deliver the baby, and Bob offered the woman and her new baby a cup of coffee and a place to rest. The woman was grateful, and Bob felt a surge of pride as he realized he had helped bring a new life into the world.
