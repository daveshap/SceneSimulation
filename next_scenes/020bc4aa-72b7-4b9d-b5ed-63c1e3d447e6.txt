Gabbi sat on the porch long after the Gorrila had left, her mind racing with what had just happened. She had never seen anything like it before. The children were still playing in the yard, seemingly unaffected by the whole incident. Gabbi was glad they were able to take it in stride, but she knew she would be thinking about it for a long time. Gradually, she started to relax and her mind began to wander. She thought about her life in Africa and how different it was from the life she had known in America. She missed her family and friends, but she loved the adventure of living in a new place. She would never forget the time a Gorrila came to visit her on the porch. It was an experience that she would always cherish.
