The next day, Bob and the bounty hunter set out for the nearest town. They walk for hours, and Bob is getting tired. The bounty hunter is carrying a gun, and she looks around cautiously. Bob is getting a bit worried, because he's not sure how much farther they have to go. Suddenly, the bounty hunter stops and points her gun at a tree. Bob looks at the tree, and he sees a man hiding behind it. The man is holding a gun, and he looks scared. The bounty hunter yells at the man to come out, and he does. He's shaking, and he has his hands up. The bounty hunter tells Bob to search the man, and he does. The man is carrying a knife and a map. The bounty hunter asks the man what he's doing in the forest, and he says that he's looking for his lost dog. The bounty hunter doesn't believe him, and she asks him again. This time, the man tells her the truth. He says that he's a bounty hunter, and he's been hired to find Bob. The bounty hunter is surprised, but she's not scared. She tells the man to come with them, and he does. The three of them walk to the town, and they find a place to stay for the night. The bounty hunter asks the man what his name is, and he tells her. She introduces herself, and then she asks Bob to tell his story. The man listens carefully, and at the end, he says that he believes Bob. He says that he's going to help him clear his name. Bob is relieved and happy to have someone on his side.
