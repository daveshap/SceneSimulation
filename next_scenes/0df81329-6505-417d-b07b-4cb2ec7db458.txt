Aleksy walks out of the store and is hit with a gust of cold air. He shivers and pulls his coat closer to his body. He begins to walk towards his home, which is a small dome located a few miles away. He knows he won't make it there before dark, so he decides to set up camp for the night. He finds a spot near a small crater and starts to unpack his backpack. He pulls out a small tent and sets it up. He crawls inside and zips up the entrance. He takes off his helmet and gloves and begins to eat his crackers. He stares up at the stars and wonders what life is like on Earth. He eventually falls asleep and dreams of home.
