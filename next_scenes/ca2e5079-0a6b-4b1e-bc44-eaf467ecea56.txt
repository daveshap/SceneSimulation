Jenna packed up her things slowly, her mind still reeling from the incredible experience she had just had. She couldn't believe she had actually seen elephants in the wild! She snapped another picture of them before finally turning away and heading back on the long journey home. She knew she would never forget this incredible experience. The sun was beating down on her mercilessly, and Jenna was starting to get thirsty. She stopped to take a drink from her water bottle, before trudging on through the sandy landscape. She had been walking for hours, and she was starting to get tired. Suddenly, Jenna heard a noise in the distance. She paused, listening intently. It sounded like... footsteps. Jenna's heart started to race as she realized she was being followed. She started to run, but it was too late. She felt a hand clamp down on her mouth from behind, muffling her screams. She was being dragged away into the dense jungle, and she knew she was in trouble.
