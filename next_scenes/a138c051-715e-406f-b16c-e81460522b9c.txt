The bird carries Aleksy high into the air, its powerful claws clutching him tightly. Aleksy screams and struggles, but it is no use. The bird flies over the valley, the moonlight glinting off its glossy feathers. He can see the small houses and farms dotting the landscape below, and the sparkle of the river as it winds its way through the valley. The bird begins to climb higher, and Aleksy's ears pop as the pressure changes. He looks up and sees the bird's beak opening wide, ready to devour him. Aleksy closes his eyes and prepares for the worst.Suddenly, he feels the bird's claws release him and he tumbles through the air. He flails his arms and legs, trying to grab onto something, but there is nothing to hold onto. He falls and falls, the wind rushing past his ears. He hears the bird's triumphant cry as it flies away. Just when Aleksy thinks he is going to die, he hits something soft. He opens his eyes to see he is lying in a pile of hay. He is back on the ground, safe and sound. Aleksy lets out a sigh of relief and climbs out of the haystack. He dusts himself off and looks up at the mountain, vowing never to go back up there again.
