Mashawn is walking home from the site of the new school, his mind racing with pride and satisfaction. He knows that he has made a difference in his village, and he can't wait to see the children using the new facility. As he approaches his home, he can see his wife and children waiting for him. They run to meet him, and he scooped them all up into a big hug. His wife kisses him, and they all go inside. Mashawn is tired, but he knows that he has made a difference in his village.
