Jenna walked quickly down the street, her mind still racing. She was glad her friend had texted her, she needed a distraction. She tried to focus on her friend's house, but her mind kept wandering. She was so stressed about her upcoming biology test. She knew she should be studying, but she just couldn't focus. She was sure she was going to fail. As she approached her friend's house, she took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down. She didn't want her friend to see how stressed she was. She forced a smile as she walked up to the door and rang the bell. Her friend answered the door and Jenna was enveloped in a hug. "I'm so glad you're here!" her friend said. Jenna smiled and stepped into the house. "I needed to get out of the house," she said. "I can imagine," her friend said sympathetically. "You've been studying so hard for that test." Jenna nodded. "I just feel like I'm going to fail," she said. "You're not going to fail," her friend said. "You're one of the smartest people I know." Jenna appreciated her friend's words, but she still couldn't shake the feeling that she was going to fail. She followed her friend into the living room and sat down on the couch. Maybe a little relaxation was what she needed. Her friend turned on the TV and they spent the next few hours just hanging out and distracting Jenna from her studies.
