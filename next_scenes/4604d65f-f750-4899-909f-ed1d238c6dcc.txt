Mashawn walks along the beach, admiring the sunset. He's been working hard all day and is looking forward to relax. As he approaches a quiet spot, he notices something shining in the sand. He bends down to pick it up, and it's a gold necklace. He looks around to see if anyone is nearby, but there's no one in sight. He puts the necklace in his pocket and continues walking. The next thing he knows, he's being tackled from behind. He hits the ground hard, and the wind is knocked out of him. He tries to fight back, but the attacker is too strong. He feels a sharp pain in his side and realizes he's been stabbed. He struggles to get free, but the attacker holds him down. He starts to feel lightheaded and everything goes blurry. He hears the attacker's voice say, "You shouldn't have taken what isn't yours," before everything goes black.
