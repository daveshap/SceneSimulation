Aleksy finishes putting the food away and heads to the front of the store to start sweeping. As he is sweeping, he hears a strange noise outside. He stops and listens, but the noise is gone. He shrugs and goes back to sweeping. A few minutes later, he hears the noise again, but this time it is louder. He walks to the front door and opens it, but there is nothing there. He is about to close the door when he sees a group of people walking down the street. They are all carrying guns and supplies. Aleksy knows that they are soldiers. He quickly closes the door and locks it. He knows that he needs to hide. He looks around the store and decides to hide under the counter. He is shaking and he knows that he is not safe. He is praying that the soldiers will not find him.
