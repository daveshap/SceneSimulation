Tom nervously waits for the police to arrive, keeping a close eye on the homeless man. He's not sure if the man is sick or not, but he doesn't want to take any chances. He's just about to call 911 again when he hears sirens in the distance. A few minutes later, two police officers pull up to the alley. Tom quickly fills them in on what happened, and they move to apprehend the homeless man. After a brief struggle, they manage to get him into the back of the squad car. One of the officers turns to Tom and thanks him for his help, before they drive off. Tom breathe a sigh of relief, before heading home for the night.
