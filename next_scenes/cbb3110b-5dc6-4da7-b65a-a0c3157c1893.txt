Aleksy continues to sit on the beach, watching as the sun slowly rises higher in the sky. The colors become more intense, and he can see people starting to wake up and move around on the beach. He hears the sound of laughter in the distance and sees a group of children running and playing in the sand. He smiles to himself, thinking about how much he used to enjoy coming to the beach when he was a kid. He remembers the feeling of the sand between his toes and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. He takes a deep breath and feels the fresh, salty air fill his lungs. He closes his eyes and feels the warm sun on his face. For a moment, he forgets all about his worries and just enjoys the peace and tranquility of the beach.
