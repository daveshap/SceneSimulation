Tom finishes tidying up the bar and flips the open sign to closed. He then locks the door and heads over to the jukebox to turn it off. As he's walking back towards the door, he notices something strange. There's a man standing outside, peering in through the window. The man looks agitated, and Tom can see that he's holding something in his hand. Tom quickly realizes that the man has a gun. Tom hurriedly ducks down behind the bar, his heart racing. He's not sure what to do. He knows he needs to call the police, but he doesn't want to give away his position. He decides to wait a few minutes to see what the man is going to do. The man outside is pacing back and forth, muttering to himself. Tom can see that he's sweating, and he looks like he's on the verge of panic. Suddenly, the man bangs on the door, demanding to be let in. Tom knows he can't let the man in, but he also knows he can't just leave him out there. He decides to try and talk to the man. Tom carefully stands up and speaks in a calm voice. "Hey there, what's going on?" The man whirls around, pointing the gun at Tom. "I need help," he says, his voice shaking. "I'm lost and I don't know what to do." Tom keeps his hands up in the air and takes a step back. "It's okay, I can help you. Just put the gun down and we'll figure it out." The man looks uncertain, but he slowly lowers the gun. Tom exhales a sigh of relief and comes out from behind the bar. He leads the man to a stool and tells him to sit down. He then pours him a drink and calls the police.
