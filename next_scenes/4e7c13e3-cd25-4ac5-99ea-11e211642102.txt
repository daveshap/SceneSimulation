Gabbi finishes her lunch and stretches her arms above her head. It's been a nice break, but she knows she needs to get back to work soon. She stands up and brushes the sand off her clothes. As she looks around, she notices something shining in the distance. She squints her eyes and tries to see what it is, but she can't quite make it out. She starts walking towards it, and as she gets closer, she realizes it's a spaceship. She starts running towards it, and as she gets closer, she can see someone inside. They're waving at her, and she can see they're trying to signal her to come aboard. Gabbi knows she needs to go back to work, but she can't resist the temptation to explore. She climbs aboard the spaceship and the door closes behind her.
