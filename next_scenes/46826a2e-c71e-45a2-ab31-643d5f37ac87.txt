Suddenly, Wang sees his delivery driver coming towards him through the crowd. He waves to him and the driver waves back. The driver weaves his way through the crowd and hand-delivers the food to Wang. Wang thanks him and hands him a tip. The driver smiles and heads back into the crowd. Wang opens up his food and begins to eat. He savors the flavor of the dish and enjoys the view from his spot under the Eiffel Tower.
