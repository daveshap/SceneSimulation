Tom rushes to the car to see his neighbor's wife lying in the back seat. He can see that she is not breathing and her skin is pale. He knows he needs to act fast. He tells Bill to call 911 and he will start CPR. Tom lays the woman down on the ground and begins chest compressions. He can hear the sirens in the distance and he knows help is on the way. The woman begins to cough and Tom helps her sit up. She is breathing now, but she is still very pale. The ambulance arrives and the paramedics rush to help the woman. They load her into the ambulance and Tom and Bill follow behind in Bill's car. They arrive at the hospital and the woman is rushed into the ER. The doctors and nurses are working frantically to stabilize her. Tom and Bill are led to a waiting room where they sit and wait for news. After what seems like hours, a doctor comes out to speak to them. He tells them that the woman is going to be okay. They are both relieved and grateful.
