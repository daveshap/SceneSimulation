Vlad sauntered into the store, looking around with an arrogance that made Aleksy want to shrink away. Vlad was always making people feel small, and Aleksy was no exception. Vlad padded over to where Aleksy was standing, and he smirked down at him. "You're up early this morning, Aleksy," Vlad said in a deep, booming voice. "What's in the basket?" Aleksy swallowed hard, his heart pounding in his chest. He didn't want to give Vlad any trouble, but he knew that Vlad would take whatever he wanted. "Just some produce from my farm," Aleksy said, trying to sound confident. Vlad reached into the basket and grabbed an apple, taking a big bite out of it. "Mmm, this is good," he said, smacking his lips. "I'll take this." Aleksy didn't say anything, and Vlad just laughed. "Don't worry, I'll pay you for it," Vlad said, reaching into his pocket and throwing a couple of coins on the ground. "That should cover it." Aleksy just stood there, feeling helpless. He knew there was nothing he could do to stop Vlad from taking whatever he wanted. All he could do was hope that Vlad would get bored and move on to someone else.
