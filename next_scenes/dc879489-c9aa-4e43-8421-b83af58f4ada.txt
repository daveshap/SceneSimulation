The sun slowly dips below the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. Jenna watches the colours change, feeling a sense of peace and calm wash over her. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is gently rustling the leaves. All is right in the world. Jenna feels her eyelids begin to droop, and she lets out a soft sigh. She knows she should go inside and get ready for bed, but she can't tear herself away from the peaceful scene before her. She's so lucky to live in such a beautiful place. Finally, Jenna forces herself to stand up and goes inside, closing the door behind her with a quiet click.
