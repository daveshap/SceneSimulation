The men don't say anything as they push past her into the cottage, and Swathi's mind races as she wonders what they're going to do to her. She backs away from them, her heart pounding in her chest, as they start to look around the room. One of them goes into the kitchen, while the other starts opening up drawers in the living room. Swathi stands frozen, not knowing what to do, as they begin to rummage through her things. She sees the man in the kitchen opening up cupboards, and she knows he's looking for her laptop. She knows she has to act fast, or they're going to find it and take it away from her. She makes a split-second decision and sprints towards the man in the living room, knocking him to the ground. She grabs her laptop from the drawer and makes a run for the door, but the other man is already blocking her path. She knows she can't outrun him, so she makes a desperate lunge for the window, smashing it with her laptop. She scrambles through the opening and runs as fast as she can away from the cottage, with the men hot on her heels. She knows she can't let them catch her, or they'll take her laptop and she'll never see it again. She runs and runs until she reaches the edge of the forest, and then she dives into the trees, hoping to lose them in the darkness.
