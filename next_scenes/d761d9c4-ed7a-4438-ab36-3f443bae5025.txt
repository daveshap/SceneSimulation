Aleksy is in shock as he watches the Eiffel Tower fall. He can't believe what he's seeing. He looks around and sees people running and screaming everywhere. He looks up and sees that the tower is about to fall on him! He runs away as fast as he can and narrowly misses being crushed by the fallen structure. He's covered in dust and debris from the collapse. He looks around and sees that the area around the tower is completely destroyed. He can hear people crying and moaning all around him. He's in a state of shock as he tries to process what he's just seen.
