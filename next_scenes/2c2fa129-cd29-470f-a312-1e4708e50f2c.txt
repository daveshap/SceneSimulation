Tom feels the warmth of the sun on his face and the softness of the sand below him. He takes a sip of his cocktail and savors the flavor of the rum. He feels relaxed and happy. He opens his eyes and looks out at the ocean. He sees the waves crashing against the shore and the birds flying overhead. He hears the sound of the waves and the sound of the birds. He smells the salt in the air and the fragrance of the flowers. He feels the breez blowing through his hair.
