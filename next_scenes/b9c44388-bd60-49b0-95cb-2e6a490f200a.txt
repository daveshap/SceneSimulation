Jenna finishes her dinner and washes her dishes before heading outside to survey the damage to her garden. She is dismayed to see that the buck has not only uprooted her flowers and trampled her vegetables, but it has also knocked over her fence. Jenna begins to pick up the fence posts, trying to assess how much damage has been done. As she is picking up the posts, she hears a noise from the woods. She slowly stands up, listening carefully. She hears the noise again and realizes that it is the sound of the buck coming back. She quickly grabs her shotgun and runs into the woods, yelling at the buck to try and scare it away. The buck only looks at her, seeming almost defiant, before turning and running off into the woods. Jenna is relieved that the buck is gone but is sadly left with the mess it has made of her garden. She knows it will take weeks of hard work to repair the damage, but she is determined to get her garden back to its former glory.
