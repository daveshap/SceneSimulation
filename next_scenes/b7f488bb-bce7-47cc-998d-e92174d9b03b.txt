The ambulance arrives within minutes, and the EMTs rush inside to assess the situation. Wang shows them where the resident is and stands back while they work. Within a few minutes, they have the resident on a stretcher and are wheeling them out to the ambulance. The police are still on the scene, taking Wang's statement. They ask him a few questions about what he saw and what he did, and then they thank him for his help. Wang is glad that he was able to do something, and he hopes that the resident will be okay.
