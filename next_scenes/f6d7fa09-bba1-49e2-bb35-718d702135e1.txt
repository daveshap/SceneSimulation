Bob finishes his coffee and heads to his office on the third floor. As he walks, he sees the woman from the coffee shop walking down the hall. She seesBob and smiles. "Thank you so much for your help," she says. "My computer is all fixed now." Bob waves and says, "No problem. I'm just glad John was able to help you." The woman nods and then continues on her way. Bob arrives at his office and sits down at his desk. He starts to work on some reports but is interrupted by a knock at the door. He gets up to answer it and finds John standing there. "Hey, man, I wanted to thank you for sending that woman my way," John says. "No problem," Bob replies. "I'm just glad you were able to help her." John nods and then says, "Well, I gotta get back to work. Thanks again." Bob nods and then closes the door. He goes back to his desk and continues working on his reports.
