Aleksy's break time finally arrives, and he takes a seat on one of the benches in the park across the street from the grocery store. He pulls out his lunch from his backpack and takes a few bites of his sandwich before spotting the woman from the store walking towards him. She sees him sitting on the bench and hesitates for a moment before coming over. "Hello," she says quietly, sitting down next to him. "I wanted to thank you for your help back at the store. My name is Lily." Aleksy introduces himself and the two chat for a bit. Lily seems a bit more relaxed now, but Aleksy still wonders about the object she was holding earlier. Finally, he musters up the courage to ask her about it. "It's nothing, really," Lily says, fidgeting with the object in her hand. "Just a lucky charm that my grandmother gave me." Aleksy nods, understanding now. He thanks Lily for talking with him and bids her farewell. As he watches her walk away, he can't help but feel a bit more lucky himself.
