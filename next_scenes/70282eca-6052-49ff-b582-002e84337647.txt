Tom quickly hops to his feet and begins making his way down the mountain, picking up speed as he goes. He knows that the group of people heading up the mountain is headed for the bar he works at, and he wants to be there to greet them and get things started. As he nears the bottom of the mountain, he can see the group more clearly. They look like they're ready for a party, with their loud laughter and carefree attitudes. Tom can't help but smile as he begins to prepare the bar for the night ahead.
