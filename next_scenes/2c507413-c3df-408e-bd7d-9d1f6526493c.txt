The sun continued to rise, casting an ever-brightening glow over the landscape. Tom stood behind the bar, his arms crossed, as he watched the group of men approach. He could see the anger in their eyes, and he knew they were looking for a fight. The first man stepped up to the bar and slammed his fist down, demanding a drink. Tom ignored him and turned to the next man, who was already starting to swing at him. Tom ducked out of the way and grabbed the man's arm, twisting it behind his back. The man yelped in pain and Tom shoved him away, before turning to face the rest of the group. They were all shouting now, and Tom could see the violence in their eyes. He knew he was in for a long night.
