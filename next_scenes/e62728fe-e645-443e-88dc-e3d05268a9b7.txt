Bob is still standing in the middle of the concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He's still holding his cup of coffee in one hand and his book in the other, and he looks like he's still enjoying himself immensely. He's still tapping his foot along to the beat and swaying slightly from side to side, and every now and then he takes another sip of his coffee. He's clearly still in his element here, surrounded by the music and the people. The only difference now is that Bob has started to bob his head along to the beat of the music, and he's swaying his hips a bit more than before. He looks like he's really enjoying himself, and he's got a big smile on his face.
