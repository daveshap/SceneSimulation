Sandy finishes her chant and opens her eyes. The crystal in her hand is now dull and lifeless. She looks around at the people with her, all of whom are now asleep. Sandy stands up and walks to the edge of the mountaintop. She looks out at the landscape below, all of which is cloaked in darkness. In the distance, she can see the lights of a city. Sandy takes a deep breath and jumps off the edge of the mountaintop.
