Jenna and the little girl sat on the sand, trying to catch their breath. Jenna was still in shock from what had just happened. She couldn't believe that there was a shark in the water. She looked over at the little girl and could see that she was still shaken up. Jenna wrapped her arms around her and tried to comfort her. They sat there for a few minutes, until Jenna finally gathered the strength to stand up. She walked over to the little girl's parents, who were standing on the shore, waiting for their daughter. They were both relieved and thankful that Jenna was able to save her. Jenna said her goodbyes and started to walk away, when she suddenly remembered that she left her towel and bag on the beach. She turned around and started to walk back, but then she heard someone yelling. She looked over and saw that the shark was still there, thrashing around in the water. Jenna's heart started to race as she realized that she would have to go back into the water to get her things. She didn't know if she could do it, but she knew she had to try. Jenna took a deep breath and ran towards the water.
