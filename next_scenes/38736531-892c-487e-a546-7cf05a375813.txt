Aleksy continues working diligently, making sure that everything is in its proper place. He hears a commotion coming from one of the offices and goes to investigate. He find that a vase has been knocked over and broken. He looks around to see if anyone is nearby who could have seen what happened, but there is no one in sight. Aleksy carefully cleans up the mess and goes back to his work.
