Swathi was paralyzed with fear as she felt the hand over her mouth. She tried to scream, but no sound came out. She could feel the person's hot breath on her neck, and she knew she was in trouble. She started to struggle, but the person was too strong. Then she felt something cold and sharp pressed against her throat. "Don't make a sound," the person whispered. "If you do, I'll kill you." Swathi's whole body was shaking, and she was sure she was going to die. Then the person started to drag her away, and she knew she was in for a long night.
