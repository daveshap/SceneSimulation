Mashawn is lost and alone in the dark forest. He is scared and doesn't know what to do. He starts to walk in a random direction, hoping to find his way back to camp. He is getting tired and thirsty. He sees a light in the distance and starts to walk towards it. As he gets closer, he realizes it is a campfire. He is relieved and happy to see people. He walks into the camp and sees a group of men sitting around the fire. They are all dirty and have guns. They look at Mashawn and one of them points a gun at him.
