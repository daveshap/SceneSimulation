The sun continues to set, and Gabbi watches the sky change from a bright blue to a deep purple. She hears the sound of crickets chirping and the leaves rustling in the breeze. She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes, letting the peace of the moment wash over her. Suddenly, she hears a loud crash from inside the house. She jumps up, heart racing, and runs to the door. She opens it to find the kids have gotten out of bed and are running around, laughing and playing. Gabbi sighs in relief and shakes her head. It looks like her moment of peace is over.
