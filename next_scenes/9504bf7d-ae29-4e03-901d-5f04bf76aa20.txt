Sandy is inside her apartment, putting away the groceries. She's still thinking about the homeless man she saw outside. She can't get his face out of her mind. She wonders what his story is. She wonders if he has any family. Sandy decides she should do something to help him. She decides to make a bag of food for him. She puts together a sandwich, some chips, and a bottled water. She takes the bag of food and starts to head back out to the man. As she's walking, she starts to feel uneasy. She starts to think maybe she shouldn't do this. What if he's dangerous? What if he tries to hurt her? Sandy starts to walk faster. She's almost to her building when she hears someone running up behind her. She turns around and sees the homeless man. He's panting and sweating. He looks like he's about to collapse. He reaches out and grabs Sandy's arm. Sandy feels her heart racing. She's terrified. The man looks into her eyes and whispers, "Help me."
