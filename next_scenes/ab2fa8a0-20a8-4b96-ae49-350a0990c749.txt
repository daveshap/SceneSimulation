After a few moments, he decides to call the police. He hopes they'll be able to catch the teenagers before they can get away. Aleksy reaches for his phone and starts to dial 911, but before he can finish, one of the teenagers notices him and starts to run towards him. Aleksy's heart races as he tries to back away, but the teenager is too fast. He tackles Aleksy to the ground and starts to punch him. Aleksy tries to hits back, but the teenager is too strong. He feels his nose start to bleed and he knows he's in trouble. Suddenly, the other teenagers stop what they're doing and run over to help their friend. They start kicking Aleksy while he's down, and he feels his ribs start to crack. He's in immense pain and he knows he needs to get away. He tries to get up, but the pain is too much and he falls back down. The teenagers see that he's not getting up, and they start to run out of the store. Aleksy lays on the ground, trying to catch his breath, as he hears the sound of sirens in the distance. He knows the police are on their way, but he's not sure if he's going to make it.
