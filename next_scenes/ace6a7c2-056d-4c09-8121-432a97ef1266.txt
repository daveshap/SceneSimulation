Tom is still standing at the bar, staring at the 100 credit chip in his hand, trying to figure out what to do with it. He knows it's worth a lot of money, but he's not sure how much. He decides to put it in the till and see what happens. He's just about to put it in when the door opens and the customer walks back in. Tom's heart sinks. He knows he's not supposed to leave until the last customer has left. The customer walks up to the bar and says, "I forgot to tell you, that chip is worth 100 credits. You can use it to buy anything you want." Tom is surprised and happy. He thanks the customer and they say their goodbyes. Tom is left standing at the bar with a 100 credit chip in his hand, wondering what to buy.
