The customer comes running up to the coffee shop, his spaceship crashed and he needs a cup of coffee to help him think. Bob calmly gets up and goes inside to make his customer a cup of coffee. He knows that when you're stranded on the moon, a good cup of coffee can be the difference between life and death. The customer takes a seat at the counter and Bob hands him a cup of coffee. The customer takes a sip and then lets out a sigh of relief. "Thank you, Bob. I don't know what I would've done without you." Bob just smiles and nods, knowing that he's just happy to be of help.
