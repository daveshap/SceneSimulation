Swathi continues to work on her project, typing away at her laptop. She occasionally stops to check her phone, which is still sitting on the table next to her. She is starting to get tired, and her eyes are starting to droop. She rubs her eyes and takes a deep breath, trying to stay awake. She looks at her watch and sees that it is 3:00 a.m. She knows she needs to keep working, but she can't keep her eyes open. She tries to stand up and stretch her legs, but her body is too tired. She sits back down and tries to focus on her work, but her eyes keep drooping. She finally decides to give up and goes to lie down in her sleeping bag. She sets her alarm for 6:00 a.m. and falls asleep.
