Wang wakes up to the sound of chanting. He rubs his eyes and sits up, stretching. He looks around the room, taking in the simple furnishings. There is a bed, a desk, and a small window. The sun is just peeking over the mountains, and the sky is a beautiful pink. Wang climbs out of bed and goes to the window. He can see the monks in the courtyard below, walking in a circle and chanting. He watches them for a moment, then gets dressed and goes downstairs. The abbot is waiting for him in the dining hall. He greets Wang and tells him to sit down. A bowl of porridge is waiting for him, and Wang gratefully begins to eat. The abbot watches him for a moment, then speaks. "You have a long journey ahead of you, Wang. Are you sure you're up for it?" Wang nods, his mouth full. He finishes eating and wipes his face with a napkin. "I'm ready," he says. The abbot nods and hands him a small package. "You must deliver this to the monastery on the other side of the mountain. It is very important." Wang takes the package and puts it in his pocket. He stands up and thanks the abbot for his hospitality. Then he picks up his pack and starts down the path. The sun is high in the sky now, and Wang is getting tired. He stops to rest in the shade of a tree. He takes a drink of water from his canteen and eats a snack from his pack. Then he gets up and continues on his way. eventually he reaches the monastery. He steps inside and is greeted by a monk. The monk takes the package and leads Wang to the dining hall. Wang is relieved to see a warm meal waiting for him. After dinner, the monk shows Wang to his room and tells him to get some rest. Wang is tired from his long journey, and he quickly falls asleep.
