Mashawn is lying on the ground, unconscious, with the beam of the Eiffel Tower on top of him. His coworkers are rushing over, trying to figure out what to do. They know they need to get him out from under the beam, but it's too heavy for them to lift. Suddenly, they hear a loud creaking noise. They look up in horror as the entire structure of the Eiffel Tower starts to collapse. They all run for cover as the tower comes crashing down, smashing Mashawn beneath it.
