Aleksy is standing in front of the grocery store, waiting for his ride home. He's still thinking about the customer from earlier, and he's starting to get curious about what it's like to live on the moon. He's never been off of Earth before, and the thought of living on another planet is starting to appeal to him. He's never been one for adventure, but he's starting to think that maybe it's time for a change. He's starting to daydream about what it would be like to live on the moon when he hears a voice behind him. "Excuse me, sir?" Aleksy turns around and sees the customer from the store. "I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with the cashier," the customer says. "It sounds like you're interested in living on the moon." Aleksy nods, and the customer continues. "I just wanted to tell you that it's an amazing place. I'm sure you would love it there." The customer says goodbye and Aleksy watches him leave. He's still not sure if he's ready for a change, but he knows that he's going to be thinking about the moon for a long time.
