The band finishes their set and leaves the stage to huge applause. Swathi makes her way out of the mosh pit, her body still buzzing with energy. She's sweaty and her hair is a mess, but she doesn't care. She's had the time of her life. She grabs a water bottle from a nearby vendor and downs it, then heads to the merch table to buy a shirt. She's chatting with the band's merch guy when she sees someone she knows. Sheexcitedly waves them over. It's her friend Sarah, who she went to the concert with. They chat for a few minutes about how amazing the show was, then head out to the parking lot. They're both exhausted from the night's events, but they can't stop smiling. They say their goodbyes and head to their separate cars. Swathi is already looking forward to the next show.
