Swathi and her co-workers finish their lunch and start to head back to their office. Swathi is in a good mood, joking and laughing with her co-workers as they walk. However, when they get to their office, they see that their boss is waiting for them. He doesn't look happy. Swathi and her co-workers exchange worried looks as they walk into the office and take their seats. The boss starts to speak. "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but we're going to have to let some of you go." There is a stunned silence in the room. Swathi can't believe it. She's been with the company for years and has always been a top performer. The boss continues, "We're just not making enough money to keep all of you on. I'm sorry." Swathi and her co-workers are horrified. They all start to speak at once, but the boss cuts them off. "I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. You'll all be given two weeks' severance pay. I'm sorry." Swathi and her co-workers are stunned. They gather their things and leave the office, their futures uncertain.
