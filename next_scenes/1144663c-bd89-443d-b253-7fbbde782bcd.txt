Tom finishes wiping down the bar and steps back to admire his handiwork. The glasses are lined up perfectly and the surface gleams in the early morning light. He knows that today is going to be busy, with tourists flooding in to get a glimpse of the famous Eiffel Tower. He's ready for it though, and he knows just how to make a perfect drink to help people relax and enjoy their day. As the day goes on, the bar gets more and more crowded. Tom is kept busy mixing drinks and chatting with the customers. He gets to know some of them, and they start to feel like old friends by the end of the day. The Eiffel Tower looms large over everything, a constant reminder of the history and beauty of this city. As the sun sets, Tom cleans up the bar, ready for another busy day tomorrow. He takes a moment to appreciate the view from the window, the tower illuminated against the darkening sky. He knows that he's lucky to work in such a beautiful city, and he can't wait to welcome more visitors tomorrow.
