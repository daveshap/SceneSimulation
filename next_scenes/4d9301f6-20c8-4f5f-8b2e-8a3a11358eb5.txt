Gabbi continues to stroke the child's hair as she sleeps, feeling a pang of sadness at the thought of her own daughter who died a few years ago. She remembers the day she found out she was pregnant, and the joy she felt at becoming a mother. She also remembers the day her daughter was born, and how perfect and small she was. Gabbi tries not to think about the day her daughter died, but she can't help it. She remembers holding her close as she took her last breath, and the all-consuming grief that followed. Gabbi feels a tear run down her cheek, but she quickly wipes it away. She doesn't want the child to see her crying. After a few minutes, Gabbi gently lays the child down on the bed and covers her with a blanket. She then quietly leaves the room, closing the door behind her.
