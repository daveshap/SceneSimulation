Aleksy was in the middle of a dream where he was winning the lottery and buying a yacht when he was jolted awake by a loud crash. He sat up in bed and realized that the noise had come from his living room. He got out of bed and grabbed a knife from his kitchen on the way to the living room. When he got there he saw that the window was broken and there was a brick on the floor. He cautiously approached the window and looked out, but didn't see anyone. He went to the door and looked out the peephole, but again, didn't see anyone. He went back to his bedroom and grabbed his phone to call the police.
