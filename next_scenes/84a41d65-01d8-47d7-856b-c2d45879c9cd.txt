Sandy wakes up to the sound of her children laughing. She opens her eyes and sees that the sun is already up. She must have slept for hours! She gets up and stretches, feeling well-rested for the first time in weeks. She goes over to the pot of stew and sees that it's still warm. She ladles out a bowl for herself and sits down to eat. Her children watch her, still giggling from their earlier game. Sandy asks them what they're laughing about and they excitedly tell her about the game they were just playing. Sandy listens, amused, as they tell her all about it. After breakfast, Sandy gets her children ready for the day. They brush their teeth and put on their clothes. Sandy opens the door of the hut and steps outside, blinking in the bright sunlight. She takes a deep breath of fresh air, feeling happy and content.
