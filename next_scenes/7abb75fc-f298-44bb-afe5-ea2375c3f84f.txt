Aleksy finished his cigarette and tossed it into the trash can next to him. He leaned against the railing, taking in the view of the city around him. The sunset cast a pink and orange glow over the skyline, and the twinkling lights of the tower were just starting to come on. Aleksy took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the cool evening air. He smiled to himself, feeling happy to be in such a beautiful place. Suddenly, Aleksy heard a commotion behind him. He turned to see a group of people running towards the tower. They were shouting and waving their arms, and it looked like they were being chased by a large group of people. Aleksy's heart started to race as he realized what was happening. He quickly ran towards the tower, hoping to make it to safety before the mob caught up to him.
