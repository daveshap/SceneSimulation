Jack takes a long sip of his drink, then looks up at Tom with a solemn expression. "I can't shake the feeling that whatever I saw out there is going to come back," he says. "I'm not sure what it is, but I know it's not natural. And it's definitely not from around here." Tom nods his head, understanding Jack's fears. "I've seen things like that before, Jack. Not on the moon, but on other planets. There are some things in the universe that are just beyond our understanding. But that doesn't mean we should be afraid of them." "I know. But it's hard not to be when you don't know what it is you're up against." "Trust me, Jack. I know what it's like to be afraid of the unknown. But the best thing you can do is face your fears head on. Only then will you be able to understand what it is you're up against." Jack nods his head, understanding what Tom is saying. He takes another sip of his drink, then stands up to leave. "I think I'm going to head home now, Tom. Thanks for the drink." "No problem, Jack. I'll see you soon." Tom watches as Jack leaves the bar, then goes back to wiping down the counter. He can't help but wonder what Jack saw out on the plains. Whatever it was, it definitely wasn't from around here.
