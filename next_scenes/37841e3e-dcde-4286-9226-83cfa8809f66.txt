Jenna scanned the menu, her eyes landing on the roasted chicken sandwich. She was starving, but she knew she wouldn't be able to eat much in this heat. She flagged down the waiter and placed her order, fanning herself with her hand as she waited. The waiter brought her a glass of ice water, and she took a long drink, grateful for the relief. As she set the glass down, she saw her friends chatting and laughing, and she felt a pang of jealousy. She knew they were just friends, but she couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be in a relationship again. She shook her head, trying to push the thoughts out of her mind. She was determined to enjoy her lunch, despite the heat.
