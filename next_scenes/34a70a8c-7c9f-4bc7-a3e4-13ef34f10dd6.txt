The jaguar moves closer to the truck, its eyes glittering in the moonlight. Wang's heart is pounding in his chest and he knows he has to act fast. He reaches for the gun he keeps in the glove compartment and aims it at the jaguar. The animal is just about to leap onto the truck when Wang fires the gun. The bullet hits the jaguar in the head and it falls to the ground, dead. Wang is shaking, but he knows he has to keep going. He drives the truck the rest of the way to the village and makes his delivery. Then he finally returns to his hotel, where he can rest and try to forget the incident in the forest.
