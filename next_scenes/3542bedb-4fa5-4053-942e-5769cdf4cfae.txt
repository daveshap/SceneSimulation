The Eiffel Tower stands tall and imposing against the darkening sky, its metal frame outlined in twinkling lights. Bob, the coffee shop owner, is busy wiping down tables and chairs, getting ready to close up for the night. He hums to himself as he works, pausing now and then to admire the view. As dusk settles in, Bob flips the sign on the door to 'Closed' and locks up. He gives the place one last sweeping glance, making sure everything is in its place, before heading off into the night. Bob walks down the street, his hands in his pockets and a spring in his step. He's looking forward to getting home to his wife and watching some television. As he approaches his car, he notices something strange. There's a man standing next to it, fiddling with the handle. Bob quickens his pace, but the man sees him and jumps into the car, speeding off into the night. Bob is stunned. He can't believe what just happened. His car has been stolen! He stands there for a moment, trying to process what just happened, before heading off to call the police.
