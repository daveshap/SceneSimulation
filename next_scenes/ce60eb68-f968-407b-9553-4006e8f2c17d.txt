The sun slowly rises over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the lunar landscape. Gabbi watches as the shadows start to fade away, and she begins to feel a bit better. She's still a bit jumpy, but she's glad to see the light of day. She spends the rest of her shift going over the data from the previous day and making sure everything is in order. She's glad when her relief arrives and she can finally take a break. She stretches her arms and legs and takes a deep breath of relief. It's been a long night, but she's glad it's over.
