The next day, Jenna woke up early and decided to go for a walk. She wandered through the fields, enjoying the peace and quiet. The sun was just starting to rise, and the sky was a beautiful pink. Jenna felt happy and content. As she walked, she noticed a rabbit caught in a trap. She felt sorry for the rabbit and decided to free it. She carefully opened the trap and set the rabbit free.
