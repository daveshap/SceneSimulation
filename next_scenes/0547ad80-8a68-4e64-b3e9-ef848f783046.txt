Aleksy went back to his office, his mind racing with the possibility of working closer to his office. He sat down at his desk and pulled out his phone, eager to tell his friends about the new grocery store. He quickly typed out a post, letting his friends know about the store and the job opening. He included the link to the job application and hit post. He sat back and waited, refreshing the page every few minutes to see if anyone had commented. After a few minutes, his phone buzzed with a notification. He saw that his post had gotten a few likes and a few comments. He clicked on the post to see what his friends had to say.
