Aleksy's screams echo through the forest as he is dragged away by the snake. He tries wildly to swing his machete and hit the snake, but he misses every time. The snake coils tighter around him, constricting his chest and making it difficult to breathe. Aleksy's vision starts to swim and he knows he is going to pass out. He sees the snake's mouth open wide, ready to devour him. And then everything goes black.
