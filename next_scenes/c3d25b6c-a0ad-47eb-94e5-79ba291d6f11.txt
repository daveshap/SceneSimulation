Bob awoke to the sound of voices around the campfire. He opened his eyes and saw that the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, trying to wake himself up. The people around the fire were speaking in their native language, and Bob couldn't understand a word they were saying. He got to his feet and stretched, then walked over to the fire. One of the people saw him and greeted him in English. Bob smiled and nodded, then sat down by the fire. He accepted a cup of coffee from one of the people and sipped it, savoring the rich flavor. The people were friendly, and Bob felt at ease in their company. He chatted with them for a while, then bid them farewell and set off on his journey again.
