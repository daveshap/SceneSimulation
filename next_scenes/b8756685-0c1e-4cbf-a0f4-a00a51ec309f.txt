Swathi spends the morning working on some new code for the company's software. She takes a break for lunch, eating at her desk while she continues to work. Around mid-afternoon, she starts to feel a bit tired and takes a quick nap. She wakes up a few minutes later and goes back to work. As the day comes to an end, Swathi packs up her things and says goodbye to her co-workers. She takes the elevator down to the lobby and exits the building. She walks to her car and drives home, arriving just as the sun is setting.
