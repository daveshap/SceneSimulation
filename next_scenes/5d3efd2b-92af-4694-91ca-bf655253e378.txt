Bob ran as fast as he could, the robbers hot on his heels. He could hear their angry footsteps pounding the pavement behind him. He had to lose them. He ducked into an alleyway and hid behind a dumpster. The robbers ran past, not seeing him. Bob breathed a sigh of relief. He waited a few minutes to make sure they were gone, then emerged from his hiding spot. His heart was racing. He shook his head to clear it and then started to walk back to his office. He would have to call the police from there. As he walked, he couldn't help but replay the scene in his head. He had never seen anything like that before. He wondered if the robbers had gotten away with anything. He would find out soon enough. For now, he just wanted to put the whole incident behind him.
