Wang finishes his tea and stands up, stretching his legs. He walks over to the stream and looks down at the clear water flowing by. He can see fish swimming in the depths and he smiles. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap again. This time, he's sure it's not a deer. He grabs his walking stick and turns around, prepared to defend himself. But there's no one there. He looks around carefully, but there's no sign of anyone. He relaxes and laughs to himself again. Maybe it's just the wind, he thinks. But he decides to be more careful and goes back inside his cottage.
