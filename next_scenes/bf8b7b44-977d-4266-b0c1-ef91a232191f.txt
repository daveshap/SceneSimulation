Bob walks quickly out of the concert hall, Coffee cup in hand. He feels out of place and uncomfortable in the formal setting. As he walks, he takes a sip of his coffee. He starts to feel a little better as he exits the building and walks into the night air. He looks up at the stars and takes a deep breath. The fresh air feels good and he starts to relax. He takes another sip of coffee and decides to walk around the block. As he walks, he notices the sound of music coming from a nearby bar. He hesitates for a moment, before deciding to go in.
