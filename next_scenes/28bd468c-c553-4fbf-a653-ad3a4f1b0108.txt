Sandy wakes up groggy and disoriented. Her head is throbbing and she can't see anything. It's pitch black. She feels around and realizes she's lying on the ground. She tries to stand up, but her legs are weak and she stumbles. She reaches out, trying to find something to support her, but her hands only touch emptiness. Sandy starts to panic. She has no idea where she is or how to get out. She feels around again, this time more frantically, but she still can't find anything. She starts to scream, but her voice echoes back at her, mocking her. Suddenly, she hears something moving in the darkness. Sandy freezes, her heart pounding. She can't see what's coming, but she knows it's coming for her.
