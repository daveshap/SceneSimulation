Aleksy slowly opens the door, heart pounding in his chest. He clicks on the flashlight, its beam piercing the darkness. He scans the yard, but there's no sign of the intruder. He's just about to go back inside when he hears a noise coming from the side of the house. He shines the light in that direction and sees a figure crouched down, trying to pry open the window. Aleksy shouts, "Hey! What are you doing?" The intruder glances up, then makes a break for it. Aleksy gives chase, but the intruder is too fast. He disappears into the night, leaving Aleksy alone and frustrated.
