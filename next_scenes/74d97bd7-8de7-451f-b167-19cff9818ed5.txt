Amid the sound of the welding machine and the burning metal, Shawn's.* head snaps up at the screech of metal against metal. Alarmed, he looks around to see what's happening. He sees one of the metal bars he just welded starting to buckle under the weight of the construction materials it's supposed to be holding. Shawn quickly grabs his safety harness and hooks it onto the frame of the tower to keep himself from falling.He reaches for his welding torch and starts working on the metal bar, trying to weld it back into place. His hands are shaking from the adrenaline, and he's just about to put the torch down and take a break when he hears someone shouting from below. He looks down and sees one of the other construction workers gesturing wildly and yelling for him to come down. Shawn shakes his head and points at the metal bar he's working on. The other worker nods and runs to get help. Shawn goes back to work, welding the metal bar back into place. He's relieved when it holds, and he takes a moment to catch his breath before starting to weld the next one.
