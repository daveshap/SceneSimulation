Aleksy walks into his apartment and takes a deep breath. It feels good to be home. He takes off his coat and shoes and starts to relax. He turns on the TV and sits down on the couch. He flips through the channels, looking for something to watch. He settles on a movie and starts to relax. He's almost falling asleep when he hears a knock on the door. He gets up and goes to the door. He looks through the peephole and sees his boss. He opens the door and invites him in. His boss starts to talk but Aleksy interrupts him. He tells his boss that he's been working all day and he's tired. His boss apologizes and says he won't stay long. He just wanted to talk to Aleksy about something. Aleksy sits down and listens to his boss. His boss tells him that the grocery store is doing well but he's thinking about selling it. Aleksy is shocked. He asks his boss why he's thinking about selling the store. His boss tells him that he's getting older and he wants to retire. He's been thinking about it for a while and he's made up his mind. Aleksy is sad to hear this. He's been working at the store for years and he loves it. His boss tells him that he doesn't have to make a decision right away. He just wanted to let him know what was going on. Aleksy thanks his boss for telling him and they say goodbye. Aleksy goes back to his couch and sits down. He's glad his boss told him but he's not sure what he's going to do.
