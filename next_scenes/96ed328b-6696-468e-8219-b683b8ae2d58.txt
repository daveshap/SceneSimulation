Mashawn squints as the sun rises higher in the sky, the light becoming brighter and more intense. He can see the construction site in greater detail now, and he can make out the figures of the workers moving around. He can't help but feel a sense of pride as he looks at the progress they've made. The wind picks up, sending a chill through Mashawn. He shivers and pulls his coat tighter around him. He hears the sound of a helicopter in the distance and looks up to see it approaching. It's his ride back to the construction site. He gives one last look at the valley below before turning to head back down the mountain. He can't wait to get back to work and see the finished product.
