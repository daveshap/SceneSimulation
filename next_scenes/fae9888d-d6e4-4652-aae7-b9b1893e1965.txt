Bob is sitting in his beach chair, watching the sun set and enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, when he hears a loud noise coming from the direction of the coffee shop. He opens his eyes and sees a group of kids running and laughing, throwing things around and acting like they're having the time of their lives. Bob knows that he should probably go over and see what's going on, but he can't help but feel a little annoyed at the disruption of his peaceful evening. He gets up from his chair and walks towards the coffee shop, his towel trailing behind him in the sand. As Bob gets closer, he can see that the kids have broken into the shop and are helping themselves to the food and drink. He quickens his pace, but before he can reach the shop, the kids scatter and are gone. Bob enters the shop and assesses the damage. He sees that the cash register is open and the till is empty. All of the food and drink has been taken. Bob feels a mix of anger and sadness as he surveys the mess that the kids have made. He knows that it will take a lot of work to clean up and restock the shop, but he's determined to do it. Bob spends the next few hours cleaning up the mess and restocking the shelves. He's exhausted by the time he's finished, but he feels a sense of satisfaction at having put the shop back in order. He locks up the shop and heads back to his chair on the beach, where he sits and watches the sun set.
