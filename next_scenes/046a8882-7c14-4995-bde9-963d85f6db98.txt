The baby's cries echo in the cold, dark night, penetrating Gabbi's eardrums like daggers. She's tried everything to get the baby to sleep, but nothing seems to work. She's rocked her, sung to her, even walked her around the room, but the baby just won't go to sleep. Gabbi is about to give up and go home when she finally hears the sound of the baby's cries subsiding. She looks over and sees that the baby has finally fallen asleep. Relieved, Gabbi puts the baby down in her crib and heads home, grateful that her long night is finally over.
