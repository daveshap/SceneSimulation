Sandy's husband comes upstairs and finds her in bed. "Sandy, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you." "It's okay," she says, forgiving him. "I love you." "I love you too," he says, before giving her a kiss goodnight. Sandy is relieved that it was just her husband and not an intruder. She feels silly for being so scared and decides to just laugh it off. "Next time, just come upstairs and let me know it's you. You don't have to sneak around in the dark." "I will," he says. "I'm sorry again for scaring you." "It's okay," she says. "I love you." "I love you too," he says. They both fall asleep, feeling safe and secure in each other's arms.
