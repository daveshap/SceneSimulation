John drives away from the cottage, and he's deep in thought. He's trying to decide what to do about his employees. He knows that he needs to do something, but he's not sure what. He decides to go to the only person who can help him. He drives to the city and parks in front of a tall building. He walks into the building and takes the elevator to the top floor. He walks into an office, and a woman is sitting behind a desk. The woman is John's therapist, and she's been helping him with his problems for years. John sits down in the chair, and he starts to cry. He tells the therapist about his employees and how they're making his life difficult. The therapist listens carefully and offers her advice. John thanks her and leaves the office. He feels a little better, but he's still not sure what to do.
