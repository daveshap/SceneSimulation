Sandy pulls into the driveway and parks her car. She sits for a moment, thinking about what she'll make for dinner. She's not really in the mood to cook, but she doesn't want to order takeout again. She gets out of the car and walks to the front door. She unlocks it and steps inside. The house is quiet and dark. She flips on the light in the living room and sets her purse down on the couch. She walks to the kitchen and opens the fridge. She stares inside for a moment, then closes it and opens the pantry. She pulls out a can of soup and a bag of chips. She sets them on the counter and gets a bowl from the cupboard. She opens the can of soup and pours it into the bowl. Then she opens the bag of chips and crumbles them on top. She grabs a spoon from the drawer and carries her bowl to the living room. She sits on the couch and turns on the TV. She flips through the channels, looking for something to watch. She settles on a rerun of her favorite show and starts to eat.
