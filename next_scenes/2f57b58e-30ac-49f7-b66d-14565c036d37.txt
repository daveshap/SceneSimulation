Wang drives away from the cottage, a satisfied smile on his face. It's nice to know that he's helped brighten someone's day, even if it's just in a small way. He continues his delivery route, making stops at a few more homes and businesses. He enjoys the peacefulness of the morning and the fresh air. He knows that he's lucky to have a job that he enjoys so much. After a few more deliveries, Wang heads back to the truck depot. He turns in his truck and signs off for the day. He waves to his coworkers as he heads to his car. He's looking forward to spending the rest of the day with his family.
