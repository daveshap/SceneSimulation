Mashawn stands over the intruder, heart pounding in his chest. He can't believe he just hit someone with his hammer. He didn't mean to hurt them, but he's glad he was able to defend himself. He bends down and shakes them, but there's no response. They're definitely unconscious. He stands up and looks around, trying to figure out what to do next. He hears sirens in the distance and knows he needs to get out of there. He grabs his things and runs out the back door, escaping just as the police arrive. He's glad he wasn't caught, but he can't help but feel shaken by the whole ordeal.
