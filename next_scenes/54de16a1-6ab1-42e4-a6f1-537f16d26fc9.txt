The sun has disappeared behind the horizon, leaving the African plains in darkness. Aleksy is standing at the front of the store, peering out through the window. He's been standing there for hours, ever since he Pepper-sprayed the lions and they ran off. He knows they'll be back, and he's determined to defend the store. He's exhausted, but he can't afford to fall asleep. He heard the lions earlier, prowling around outside. They haven't made a move since then, but Aleksy knows they're out there, waiting to strike. Suddenly, Aleksy hears a loud crash. He looks over to see the lions bursting through the front door, trampling over the broken glass. Aleksy raises the can of pepper spray and starts spraying them, but it's no use. The lions are on him in seconds, knocking him to the ground. He feels their teeth sinking into his flesh and he knows he's about to die. There's nothing he can do to stop them. He closes his eyes and accepts his fate.
