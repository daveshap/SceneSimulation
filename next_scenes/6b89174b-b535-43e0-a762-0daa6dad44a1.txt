The band finishes their set to a roaring crowd. Swathi is still surrounded by people, but she feels a bit more relaxed now that the music has stopped. She enjoys chatting with the people around her, and laughing at their jokes. She's made some new friends, and she's even exchanged numbers with a few of them. All in all, she's having a great time. As she's about to leave, she hears someone calling her name. She turns around to see a tall, handsome man walking towards her. He's got aMischief Makerse tattoo on his arm, and she can't help but smile. They chat for a bit, and she finds out that his name is Liam. He's a local musician, and he's invited her to come see his band play next week. She agrees, and they exchange numbers before parting ways.
