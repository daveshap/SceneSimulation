Swathi is hurrying to catch her train to work. She's wearing a tailored navy suit and carrying a laptop bag over her shoulder. The streets are still relatively empty at this hour, but Swathi knows that won't last long. She quickens her pace, crossing the street and darting down an alleyway that will take her to the train station. She can hear the sound of traffic starting to build up on the main streets and the occasional honk of a horn. The fresh morning air feels good as she walks, and she can't help but feel a sense of excitement for the day ahead. She's been working on a new project at the office and is anxious to get started on it. As she rounds the corner into the train station, she spots her train pulling in. She quickens her pace even more, sprinting towards the platform. She makes it just in time, leaping onto the train as the doors are closing. She finds a seat and settles in for the ride, her mind already starting to race with ideas for the project. The train ride is relatively short, but it gives Swathi time to go over her notes one last time. She wants to be prepared when she presents her ideas to her boss. She knows he's been skeptical of her work lately, and she doesn't want to give him any reason to doubt her. She arrives at the office and heads to her desk. Her boss comes by a few minutes later and asks her to come to his office. She knows this is it - the moment she's been waiting for. She takes a deep breath and follows him into his office.
