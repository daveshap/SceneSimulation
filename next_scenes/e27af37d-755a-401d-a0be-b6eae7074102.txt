Jenna is so excited that she almost forgets she's tired. She walks a little faster now, her eyes fixed on the elephants. As she gets closer, she starts to feel a little nervous. She's never been this close to wild animals before! But she's also really excited, and she can't wait to see them up close. When she's just a few feet away, she stops and looks at them. They're so big! And they're just standing there, looking at her. She looks at them for a long time, until she realizes that it's getting dark and she needs to get home. As she walks away, she can't help but feel grateful for this special moment that she's just experienced.
