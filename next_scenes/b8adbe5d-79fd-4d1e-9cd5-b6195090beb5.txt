She looks down and sees that she's cleanly bandaged up. She lies back down and tries to remember what happened. The last thing she remembers is a man coming towards her with a knife. She starts to cry and a nurse comes into the room to comfort her. Jenna is traumatized and shaken up, but she's alive. The police are called and Jenna gives a description of the man who attacked her. She's unable to give a very detailed description, but they're hoping that someone will come forward with information. In the meantime, Jenna is being monitored closely and is under 24-hour security. She's safe now, but she's changed. This incident has left her scared and feeling vulnerable. She's not sure if she'll ever be able to go back to the beach again.
