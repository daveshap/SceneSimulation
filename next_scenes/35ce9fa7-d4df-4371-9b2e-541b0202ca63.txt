Mashawn enjoys the feel of the warm sun on his skin as he lies on the beach. He can hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore and the sound of seagulls in the distance. He feels relaxed and his muscles start to feel loose. After a few minutes, he gets up and dusts the sand off of his swim trunks. He looks out at the water and thinks about going for another swim, but he knows he should get back to work. He climbs back up to his work site and gets back to work on the project.
