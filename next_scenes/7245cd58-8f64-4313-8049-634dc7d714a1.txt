The man walks away from Sandy's lifeless body, heart heavy with sadness. He knows he shouldn't have kill her, but she left him no choice. He had been stranded on the moon for weeks, slowly losing his mind. When he saw her walk out into the lunar surface, he thought she was a mirage. But as she got closer, he realized she was real. He was so happy to see another human being, he didn't think about the consequences. When she saw him and started to back away, he panicked and opened fire. Now he regrets it, but it's too late to take it back. He knows he won't be able to go back to Earth now - he's a murderer. He'll have to find some way to make peace with what he's done and live out the rest of his days alone on the moon.
