Sandy hears the car before she sees it. It's speeding down the road, and the sound of the engine is deafening. The car is followed closely by a police car, and Sandy can hear the sirens wailing. She gets up from her lunch and walks to the edge of the porch to see what's going on. She sees the car speeding past her cottage, and she can see that the driver is a young woman. The woman looks panicked, and Sandy can see the fear in her eyes. The police car is right behind her, and Sandy watches as the two vehicles disappear down the road. Sandy goes back to her lunch, and she can't help but wonder what the young woman was doing that was so bad that she needed to flee from the police. She wonders if she'll ever find out what happened.
