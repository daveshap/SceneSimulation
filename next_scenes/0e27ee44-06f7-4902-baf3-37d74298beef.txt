Gabbi arrived home after her long night babysitting. She was exhausted and just wanted to go to bed. However, she knew she had to debrief her parents on how the night went first. She told them about how she watched TV in the living room and then fell asleep on the couch. She said she was very sorry for not coming to get them when they got home and promised it would never happen again. Her parents were understanding and told her she could go to bed. Gabbi was relieved and went to her room, where she promptly fell asleep.
