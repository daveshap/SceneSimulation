Mashawn wakes up the next morning to the sound of birds chirping outside his window. He stretches and yawns, then gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen to make breakfast. He hums to himself as he prepares his usual breakfast of eggs and toast. He sits down at the table to eat, and as he does, he hears a strange noise outside. He gets up to investigate, and as he does, he hears the noise again, louder this time. It sounds like something is crashing through the bushes. He approached the window cautiously and looks outside. To his surprise, he sees a large deer in his garden, eating his flowers. He watches it for a moment, then goes outside to shoo it away. The deer startles and runs off into the woods. Mashawn goes back inside and finishes his breakfast.
