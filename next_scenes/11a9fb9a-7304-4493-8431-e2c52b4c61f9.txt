Wang is in the middle of his concert, and he's loving every minute of it. He's surrounded by a huge crowd of people who are all dancing and singing along with the music. The atmosphere is electric, and Wang is having the time of his life. He's wearing a delivery driver uniform, and he's carrying a large package. He's completely immersed in the music and the moment.
