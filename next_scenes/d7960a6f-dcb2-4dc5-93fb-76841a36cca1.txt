The next morning, Sandy is up early, enjoying the peaceful quiet of the house. She savors a cup of coffee on the porch, watching the sun rise over the rolling hills. The kids will be up soon, so she goes inside to start breakfast. They'll need to be fed and dressed before heading off to school and her day of taking care of the house and taking care of herself. Sandy hums to herself as she works, feeling happy and content in her simple but perfect life.
