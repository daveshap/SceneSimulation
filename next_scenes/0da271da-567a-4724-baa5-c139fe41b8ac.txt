Sandy tossed and turned for what felt like hours, but she knew it was probably only been a few minutes. She was exhausted, but her mind wouldn't stop racing. She felt like she was going to scream if she had to stay in this house one minute longer. She got out of bed, quietly so as not to wake her husband and children, and walked to the window. She gazed out at the night, wondering what it would be like to be out there, under the stars, with no worries or responsibilities. She knew she couldn't just run away from her life, but sometimes she felt like she was going to explode if she had to stay here. Sandy turned away from the window and went back to bed. She lay there for a long time, until finally she fell into a fitful sleep.
