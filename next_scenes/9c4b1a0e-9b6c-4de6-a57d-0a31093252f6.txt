Mashawn is working diligently, pausing only to wipe the sweat from his brow. The machine is making a lot of noise, and he can feel the vibrations through the ground. His team is working tirelessly to keep up with him. Suddenly, there is a loud crash from the machine, and Mashawn is thrown to the ground. He looks in horror as the machine topples over the edge of the mountain, crashing down into the valley below. He quickly jumps to his feet and runs to the edge of the mountain, looking down at the wreckage. His heart sinks as he realizes that there is no way anyone could have survived the fall. He looks back at his team and sees the looks of shock and devastation on their faces. They all knew that this was a dangerous job, but they never expected to lose one of their own. Mashawn is filled with grief and regret as he realizes that this accident will haunt him for the rest of his life.
