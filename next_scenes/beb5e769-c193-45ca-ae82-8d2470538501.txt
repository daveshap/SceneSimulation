Tom walks down the mountain, taking in the fresh air and enjoying the peacefulness of the night. He thinks about his busy evening at the bar and how much he enjoys his job. He loves getting to know the customers and making them feel welcome in such a beautiful setting. As he approaches his home, he can hear the sound of music and laughter coming from inside. He knows his wife and kids are still up, and he can't help but smile as he opens the door and steps into the warmth of his home.
