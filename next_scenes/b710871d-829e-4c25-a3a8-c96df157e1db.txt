Wang climbs out of the truck and stretches his legs. He looks up at the Eiffel Tower and marvels at its height. He then turns and looks at the address he is suppose to deliver to. It is a large, imposing structure and he can see that it will be a challenge to find the correct entrance. He grabs the delivery from the back of the truck and sets out to find the entrance. He walks around the building for a few minutes before he finally finds the entrance he is looking for. He goes inside and is met by a receptionist. He tells the receptionist who he is and why he is there. The receptionist tells him to have a seat and wait for a moment. Wang does as he is told and takes a seat. He looks around the room and notices that it is very lavish. He has never seen anything like it before. After a few minutes, a man comes out and introduces himself as the owner of the building. He tells Wang that he will take the delivery. Wang hands over the package and the man thanks him. Wang turns to leave but the man stops him and asks if he would like a tour of the building. Wang is surprised but he agrees. The man gives him a tour of the building and Wang is amazed by the opulence. He has never seen anything like it before. When the tour is over, the man thanks Wang for his time and hands him a business card. Wang thanks the man and leaves the building. He climbs into his truck and drives away, wondering if he will ever have the chance to see the inside of the building again.
