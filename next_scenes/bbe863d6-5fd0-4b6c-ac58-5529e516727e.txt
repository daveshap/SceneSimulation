The gazelle wanders off into the bushes, and Swathi continues on her walk. She marvels at the different plants and animals she sees, and feels thankful for the chance to experience this amazing place. As she walks, she notices a small bird flitting around in the bushes. It's so fast she can barely see it, but she's enchanted by its beauty. She stops to watch it for a few moments, until it suddenly flies away. With a smile, she resumes her walk. She doesn't get far before she hears a loud crashing sound. She freezes, her heart racing. What could it be? Is there a dangerous animal nearby? She slowly backs away, ready to run if necessary. But then she hears a light chuckle, and she realizes the noise was just a herd of elephants playing around. She laughs in relief, and watch the elephants for a while before continuing on her walk. The sun is starting to get lower in the sky, and Swathi knows she should head back soon. But she's having such a nice time, she decides to stay out for just a little while longer. She walks to the edge of a small pond, and sits down to enjoy the peacefulness of the moment. She closes her eyes, and feels the cool breeze on her face. It's been a perfect day.
