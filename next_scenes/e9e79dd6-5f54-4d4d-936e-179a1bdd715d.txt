Aleksy and the woman made their way back down the mountain, hand in hand. The woman was grateful to have Aleksy's help, and she leaned on him for support as they walked. Aleksy was glad he had been there to help her; he knew how easy it was to get lost on the mountain. Finally, they reached the edge of the forest and Aleksy's village came into view. The woman breathed a sigh of relief. Aleksy led her to his house and went inside to get his wife. "Martha, I found this woman on the mountain. She's been lost for hours and she's hungry and cold. Can we help her?" Martha nodded and beckoned for the woman to come inside. She led her to the kitchen and sat her down at the table. Then she began to prepare a hot meal for her. Aleksy sat with the woman while she ate, and Martha listened as she told her story. When she was finished, Martha said, "You're welcome to stay here for the night. Aleksy will show you to a room where you can sleep." The woman thanked them both and Aleksy showed her to a room upstairs. Then he went back downstairs to sit with Martha by the fire. "That was a kind thing you did, Aleksy," Martha said. "Not everyone would have helped a stranger like that." Aleksy shrugged. "I just did what anyone would do in a situation like that." Martha smiled and took his hand. "You're a good man, Aleksy. I'm glad I married you." Aleksy squeezed her hand and leaned in to kiss her. "I'm glad I married you too, Martha."
