Aleksy got out of bed and went to his window. He looked out at the cityscape and sighed. He felt like he was trapped in his life and he didn't know how to get out. He was considering just leaving everything behind and starting over somewhere new. He had always wanted to travel, but he never had the opportunity. He didn't have any money saved up, but he could get a loan and then just pay it back over time. He could sell all of his belongings and use that money to help fund his trip. He was getting more and more excited about the idea the more he thought about it. He decided that he would leave in the morning and just start walking. He would figure out the rest as he went.
