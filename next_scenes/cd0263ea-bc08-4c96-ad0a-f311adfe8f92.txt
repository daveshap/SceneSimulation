Gabbi starts to feel uneasy as she sits in the dark forest. She can hear the children laughing and playing nearby, but she can't shake the feeling that something is watching her. She looks up at the sun and sees that it is high in the sky, but the shadows of the tall trees seem to be creeping closer. She starts to feel like she is being suffocated by the darkness. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap near her. She jumps up, ready to run, but she sees the children running towards her, laughing and calling her name. They were just playing a game and trying to scare her. Gabbi sighs in relief and scolds the children for playing such a trick on her. She then finishes her lunch and continues to watch the children as they play.
