Swathi looks up at the stars for a few more moments, taking in the sight of the infinite expanse of space. She then turns her attention back to the lunar base, and begins walking towards it. As she approaches, she can see her team working on various parts of the base. Some are working on the foundation, others are putting up walls, and still others are working on the roof. Swathi is impressed by the progress they have made in such a short amount of time. She walks into the base, and is greeted by her team. They are all excited to see her, and ask her about her experience on the surface of the moon. Swathi tells them all about her experience, and how amazed she was by the sight of the stars. She also tells them about her excitement for the project, and how proud she is to be a part of it. They all share in her excitement, and are eager to continue working on the base.
