Aleksy makes his way back to the grocery store, his mind racing with what he just saw. He's never seen anything like that before, and he's not sure what to make of it. He enters the store and goes to the back room to tell his boss what happened. His boss is surprised and Aleksy can tell that he doesn't believe him. Aleksy starts to doubt himself, wondering if maybe he imagined the whole thing. But then he remembers the sandwich, and how real it felt when the monkey snatched it right out of his hand. He knows he didn't imagine it, but he still can't believe it happened. He decides to go back to the clearing to see if he can find any evidence of the monkey. He looks for footprints or any other signs that the monkey was there, but he doesn't find anything. He does find his knife, however, and he takes it as a souvenir of his strange encounter. Aleksy will never forget what happened that day, and he'll always wonder if he really did see a monkey in the forest.
