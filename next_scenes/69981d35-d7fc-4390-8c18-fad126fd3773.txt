Mashawn walks into his apartment and is greeted by his dog, Max. He gives Max a pat on the head and then heads to the kitchen to make himself a drink. He opens the fridge and grabs a beer, then heads to the living room to relax on the couch. He turns on the TV and starts flipping through the channels, looking for something to watch. After a few minutes, he settles on a movie and starts to relax. He doesn't notice the time passing as he watches the movie, and soon it's time for bed. He gets up and stretches, then heads to his bedroom and gets ready for bed.
