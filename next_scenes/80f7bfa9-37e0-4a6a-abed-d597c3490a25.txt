Bob wakes up to the sound of birds chirping outside his window. He feels well-rested and refreshed after a good night's sleep. He climbs out of bed and stretches his arms, taking a deep breath in. He walks to the window and opens the curtains, letting in the bright sunlight. He squints his eyes and looks out at the street below. He can see people walking and cars driving by. He watches as a couple walks hand in hand down the street. He smiles to himself and feels a sense of peace. He closes the curtains and goes back to bed, snuggling under the covers. He feels content and happy as he drift off to sleep.
