Jenna continues to scroll through her phone, looking at various social media sites. She sees that her best friend, Emily, has posted a picture of her and her new boyfriend. They're hugging and smiling, and look very happy. Jenna feels a small pang of jealousy, but quickly pushes it away. She's happy for Emily and her new relationship. Jenna keeps scrolling and comes across a post from her ex-boyfriend, Matt. He's with a new girl, and they look happy together as well. Jenna feels her heart sink, and she starts to tear up. She quickly scrolls past the post and puts her phone down. She sits there for a moment, trying to fight back the tears. Jenna takes a deep breath and stands up. She walks over to her bed and lays down, curlng up into a ball. She lets the tears fall, and eventually falls asleep.
