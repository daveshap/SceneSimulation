The sun slowly begins to sink below the horizon, and Swathi's mind begins to wander. She thinks about her life and all that she has accomplished. She is a software engineer and she loves her work, but she sometimes wonders if there is more to life than just her job. She is happy, but she feels like something is missing. As she watches the sun set, she feels a sense of peace and hope for the future.
