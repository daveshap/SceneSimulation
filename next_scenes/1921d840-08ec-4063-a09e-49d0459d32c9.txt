Jenna walks outside and looks around. She doesn't see any of her neighbors and she wonders if they're all asleep. She walks to the edge of her property and looks out over the savannah. She can see the elephants in the distance and she hears the lions again. She feels a sudden urge to run, to feel the wind in her fur and the grass under her paws. She starts to run and she doesn't stop until she's reached the edge of the savannah. She stands there for a moment, panting and taking in the sights and sounds of the wild. She feels alive and free and she doesn't want to go back home. She knows she can't stay out there forever, but she doesn't want to leave just yet. She decides to sit down and watch the sunset. She feels the cool breeze on her skin and she closes her eyes, letting the peace of the savannah wash over her.
