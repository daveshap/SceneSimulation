Bob was in his element as the coffee shop started to fill up with people. He loved the bustle of the evening rush and the feeling of warmth and camaraderie that came with it. He moved around the shop, making sure everyone had what they needed and chatting with customers. He loved getting to know his customers and hearing about their day. He always tried to make sure everyone felt welcome and comfortable. The coffee shop was Bob's life, and he loved every minute of it.
