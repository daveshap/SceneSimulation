The witch cackles wickedly as she takes the baby from Gabbi's arms. "Thank you, my dear. You have served me well." The baby starts to cry, and the witch jiggles it roughly in an attempt to quiet it. When that doesn't work, she sets the baby down on the floor and rummages through a drawer for a moment before pulling out a long, sharp knife. The baby crying turns to screams, and Gabbi covers her ears, trying to block out the sound. She knows she should run, but she can't make her legs move. She's frozen in place, terror coursing through her veins. The screams stop suddenly, and Gabbi opens her eyes, her heart pounding in her chest. The witch is holding the baby's severed head in one hand and the bloody knife in the other. She cackles again and licks the blood off of the blade. Gabbi turn and runs back the way she came, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows that she has just delivered a baby to a monster, and she will never forget the look on the witch's face.
