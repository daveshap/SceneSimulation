Gabbi continues to sit with the children as they lean against the Eifel Tower. They all look up at the sky and the stars begin to come out. The children point and make wishes. Gabbi looks at the children and feels happy that she gets to spend her time with them. After a while, the children start to get tired and they begin to yawn. Gabbi knows it is time for them to go to bed. She stands up and begins to herd the children away from the Eiffel Tower. They all wave goodbye to the tower and then begin to walk down the street. Gabbi walks them to their homes and tucks each child into bed. She kisses each one goodnight and tells them to have sweet dreams. Then she walks back to the Eifel Tower and sits down. She looks up at the stars and thinks about all the children she got to meet today. She feels happy and content as she sits there and enjoys the peace of the night.
