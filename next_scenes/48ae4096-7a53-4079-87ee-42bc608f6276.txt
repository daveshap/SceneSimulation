Jenna's alarm goes off, blaring loudly in her ear. She slowly opens her eyes, groaning as she realizes it's time to get up for school. She sits up in bed, stretching her arms above her head. She gets out of bed and goes over to her dresser, pulling out a pair of jeans and a shirt. She gets dressed quickly, not bothering to look in the mirror. She grabs her backpack and phone off her desk and heads for the door. She stops in the doorway, taking one last look at her room. She sighs and shakes her head before stepping out into the hallway.
