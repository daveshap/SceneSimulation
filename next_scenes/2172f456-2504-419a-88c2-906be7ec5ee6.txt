Gabbi continued to watch the children from the window, making sure they were staying safe. She was getting a little bit worried, as the mother still hadn't arrived home. Gabbi considered calling the mother to check in, but she didn't want to bother her if she was busy. Suddenly, Gabbi heard a loud crash from outside. She looked out the window and saw that a car had crashed into the park bench where the children were sitting. The children were screaming and crying, and Gabbi could see that they were all injured. She quickly called 911 and then rushed down to the park to help the children. She comforted them and stayed with them until the ambulance arrived. Gabbi was relieved when the mother arrived home and saw that her children were safe.
