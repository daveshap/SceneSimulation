Swathi continued on her way home, her mind still on the little girl. She was so happy that she was able to help reunite her with her family. As she turned the corner onto her street, she saw a group of people gathered around something. curious, she approached them to see what was going on. In the center of the group was a small child, no more than five years old. She was crying and clutching a teddy bear. "What's going on?" Swathi asked. "This little girl got separated from her parents," someone said. "We're trying to help her find them." Swathi's heart went out to the child. She remembers how scared she felt when she got lost in the city as a child. She offered to help look for the child's parents. For the next hour, Swathi and the others searched the city for the child's parents. Finally, they were found and the little girl was reunited with her family. Swathi felt good as she walked away from the scene. She was glad she could help.
