Gabbi was in the middle of her shift when the power went out. Suddenly, the concert hall was plunged into darkness. Gabbi could hear the screams of the children she was babysitting echoing in the darkness. She quickly grabbed onto one of the children's hands and tried to calm them down. With the other hand, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her cell phone to use as a flashlight. She then led the children to the nearest exit. Once they were outside, Gabbi could see that the power outage was city-wide. There were no cars on the roads and the only light came from the stars and moon. Gabbi knew she had to find someplace safe for the children. She decided to lead them to the nearby park. Gabbi was relieved when she saw the park was empty. She found a spot for the children to sit and relax while she figured out what to do next. She knew she couldn't take them home because there was no power and she didn't want them to be scared. She decided to call their parents and let them know where they were. After she made the calls, Gabbi sat down with the children and waited for their parents to come. She was grateful that she was able to keep them safe during the power outage.
