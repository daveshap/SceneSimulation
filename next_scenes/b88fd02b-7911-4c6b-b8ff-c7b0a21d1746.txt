Gabbi waves goodbye to the child's mother and starts to walk back down the street. She passes by the playground again and the children wave to her. Gabbi waves back and continues on her way. She turns onto the side street and starts to head towards her own home. As she walks, she notices a group of teenage boys hanging out near the entrance to an alleyway. The boys are laughing and joking around. One of the boys notices Gabbi and starts to say something to her, but Gabbi quickly turns her head and Pretends she didn't see him. She quickens her pace and goes around the corner onto the next street. Gabbi breathes a sigh of relief and keeps walking. She arrives at her home and goes inside.
