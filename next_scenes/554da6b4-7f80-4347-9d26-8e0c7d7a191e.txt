Aleksy is rushing outside, his heart pounding in his chest as he hears the smash of glass. He can't believe that somebody would do this - vandalizing his store and causing all this damage. He's angry and frustrated as he assesses the damage. The front window is completely smashed and there's graffiti all over the walls. He knows that it's going to cost a lot of money to fix this, and he just hopes that the insurance will cover it. He's thankful that nobody was hurt, but he can't help but feel shaken up by what just happened.
