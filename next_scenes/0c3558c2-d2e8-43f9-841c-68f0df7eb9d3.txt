Gabbi finishes tucking the children into bed and gives them each a kiss goodnight. She heads back downstairs, where she tidies up the house and does a final check to make sure everything is in order. Once she's satisfied, she heads out the door and back home. It's been a long day, but Gabbi is happy to have spent it with the children. They are all so sweet and innocent. She knows they will have many more adventures together, on the moon and beyond.
