Aleksy slowly starts to back away from the creature, his heart pounding in his chest. He knows he should turn and run, but his feet feel like they are frozen to the ground. The creature takes another step forward, and Aleksy takes another step back. They stand there for a moment, staring at each other, before the creature finally turns and lopes off into the darkness. Aleksy watches it go, his heart still pounding in his chest, before he finally turns and continues on his way down the mountain. He can't help but feel a sense of relief as he puts distance between himself and the creature. His heart is still racing as he finally reaches the bottom of the mountain and he knows he won't be able to forget the encounter anytime soon.
