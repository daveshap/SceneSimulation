Bob can see the group of tourists approaching his shop and he knows they'll be looking for a place to rest and refuel. He's got extra coffee and pastries on hand, and he's ready to serve his customers with a smile. He knows that many of them will be stopping by his shop to take a break from sightseeing and he wants to make sure they enjoy their time here. As the group enters his shop, Bob greets them with a warm smile and asks if he can help them with anything. Many of the tourists are looking around at the different pastries and Bob points out some of his favorites. He asks if anyone would like a coffee and most of the group responds yes. Bob gets to work brewing fresh coffee and serving each customer their own cup. He chats with the group as they drink their coffee and eat their pastries, and he enjoys hearing about their day. After a while, the group starts to finish up and Bob thanks them for coming. He hopes they'll stop by again the next time they're in town. As they leave, Bob can't help but feel happy that he was able to provide them with a little bit of comfort and relaxation during their busy day.
