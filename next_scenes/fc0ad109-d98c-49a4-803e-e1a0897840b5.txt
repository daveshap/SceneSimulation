The concert is still in full swing, and the music is just as loud and energetic as before. The crowd is still dancing and cheering, and Tom is still behind the bar, serving drinks to the happy customers. He's still busy, but he's still enjoying the music and the atmosphere. Every now and then, he catches a glimpse of the stage, where the band is still playing their hearts out. He's still proud to be a part of this event, and he knows that the customers are still having a great time.
