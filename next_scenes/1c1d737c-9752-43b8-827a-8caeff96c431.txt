Bob finishes his coffee and sets the mug down on the dresser. He stands up and stretches, letting out a yawn. He wanders over to the bed and flops down, staring up at the ceiling. His mind is racing and he can't seem to relax. He hears a noise from the other room and sits up, alert. He listens for a moment, but there's nothing. He gets up and goes to the door, peeking out into the hallway. He doesn't see anything, so he goes back into the bedroom and tries to lie down again. But he can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. He gets up and goes to the window, peeking out through the blinds. He doesn't see anything out of the ordinary, but he decides to go check on Mrs. Anderson's daughter just to be safe. He grabs the key from the dresser and heads out into the hallway, locking the door behind him. He hurriedly makes his way to Mrs. Anderson's house and unlocks the door, stepping inside. He calls out for the young girl, but there's no answer. He starts to feel uneasy and begins to search the house, calling out her name. He doesn't find her anywhere, and he starts to worry that something has happened to her. He goes back outside and ends up finding her playing in the backyard. He breathes a sigh of relief and goes over to talk to her. They chat for a bit before he heads back home, his mind now at ease.
