The concert is in full swing, and the crowd is enjoying the music. Tom is busy making drinks and keeping the guests happy. He's in the middle of a busy shift, but he's loving every minute of it. He loves the music, and he loves seeing the happy faces of the guests. Suddenly, Tom notices a fight breaking out in the crowd. Two men are pushing and shoving each other, and it looks like it's about to escalate. Tom reaches for the phone to call security, but before he can make the call, the fight breaks out into a full-blown brawl. Tom jumps over the bar and rushes into the fray, trying to break up the fight. He grabs one of the men and pulls him off of the other, but it's like trying to hold back a wild animal. The man breaks free and starts swinging at Tom. Tom ducks and weaves, trying to avoid the man's punches. Suddenly, security arrives and breaks up the fight. The men are escorted out of the venue, and Tom is left shaken but unhurt. He takes a moment to compose himself, and then he goes back to work, serving drinks and keeping the guests happy.
