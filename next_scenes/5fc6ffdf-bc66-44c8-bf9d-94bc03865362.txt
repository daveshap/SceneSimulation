Sandy is suddenly pulled out of her reverie by a tap on her shoulder. She turns to see one of the security guards from the festival. He's looking at her sternly and she wonders what she's done wrong. The guard motions for her to follow him and she reluctantly does. Sandy is led backstage, where she is met by the festival organizer. He tells her that she's been dancing too close to the stage and she needs to be more careful. Sandy apologized and is allowed to go back to the crowd. She's embarrassed but tries to brush it off and enjoy the rest of the festival.
