Aleksy wakes up to the sound of the alarm still going off. He's disoriented and confused. He tries to sit up, but his body feels so heavy. He looks around and sees the emergency oxygen tanks. He knows he needs to get to them, but his body won't move. He tries to crawl, but his arms and legs are so weak. He drags himself across the floor, inch by inch. He finally reaches the tank and grabs it with his last bit of strength. He pulls the trigger and feels the oxygen flow into his lungs. He takes a few deep breaths and starts to feel better. He looks around and realizes he's the only one in the airlock. He has no idea what happened to the others. He gets up and tries the door, but it won't budge. He looks out the window and sees the airlock is still sealed. He's trapped.
