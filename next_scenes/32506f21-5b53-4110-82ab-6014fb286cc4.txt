Wang ran out of the front door and saw the delivery truck still parked in the driveway. He ran to the truck and got in, then quickly drove away. He could hear the man screaming for help from the cottage, but he didn't want to stick around to find out what was going on. He drove to the nearest police station and told them what had happened. The police sent a squad car to the cottage to investigate. When they got there, they found the man with the baseball bat. He was still wearing the mask and they couldn't see his face. The man was bleeding from the stab wound in his leg and he was taken to the hospital. The police are still investigating the incident and they haven't released any information about the man or what his motive was.
