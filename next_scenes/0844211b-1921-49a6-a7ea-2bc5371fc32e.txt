Mashawn slowly makes his way through the construction site, his lunch pail in hand. He can see his co-workers already hard at work and knows he's going to be in for a scolding from the boss. He picks up the pace, but is still a few minutes late. When he finally reaches the construction site, his boss is already there, waiting for him. Mashawn hangs his head in shame as he is scolded and told to get to work. He hurries over to his station and starts working, trying to make up for lost time. Mashawn works diligently throughout the day, taking only quick breaks to drink some water and eat his lunch. He can feel the boss's eyes on him the whole time, monitoring his every move. He knows he needs to make up for lost time and works even harder. As the day comes to an end, he is relieved to finally be done. He packs up his things and makes his way back to his apartment complex. He is exhausted from the day's work and can't wait to just relax in his bed.
