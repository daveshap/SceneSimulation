Bob runs through the alleyways, trying to put as much distance between himself and the looters as possible. He can hear them behind him, smashing and looting the coffee shop. He knows he won't be able to outrun them forever. He needs a place to hide. He spots a manhole cover and quickly lifts it, climbs down into the sewers. He replaces the manhole cover just as the looters run by. Bob sighs in relief, leaning against the wall. He knows he's safe for now. But he knows he can't stay here forever. He has to find a way out. He starts to make his way through the sewers, looking for an exit. He hears the sound of rats scurrying around in the darkness and tries to ignore it. He's getting closer to the exit. He can see a sliver of light up ahead. He starts to run towards it. But before he can reach it, he hears the sound of someone climbing down the ladder. Bob knows he's caught. He grabs his shotgun and prepares for a fight.
