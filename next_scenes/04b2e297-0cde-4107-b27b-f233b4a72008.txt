Jenna wakes up to the sound of birds chirping. She opens her eyes and sees the sun shining through the trees. She must have fallen asleep. She sits up and looks around, trying to orient herself. She remembers spending the night with the group of people and she feels a sense of warmth and safety. She's never experienced anything like it before. The woman who lent her the blanket is still asleep, and Jenna doesn't want to wake her. She quietly gets up and starts to walk away, but then she hears the woman's voice. "Hey, where are you going?" she asks. Jenna turns around and smiles. "I'm going to explore the city. I've never been to Paris before." The woman nods and smiles. "Let me know if you need anything. My name is Marie." Jenna thanks her and then continues on her way. She feels like she's in a new world. Everything is so different from what she's used to. She doesn't know where she's going, but she knows she's going to enjoy the journey.
