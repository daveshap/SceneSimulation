Jenna approaches the fire and is greeted by the people sitting around it. She is offered a seat and a blanket, which she gratefully accepts. She warms her hands by the fire and looks around at the people she is now sitting with. She sees that they are all tired and dirty, like she is. They all look like they have been through a lot, and she can see the fear in their eyes. But there is also hope in their eyes, and Jenna can see that they are all fighting to survive. She feels a sense of camaraderie with these people, and she knows that they are all in this together. She looks at the fire and wonders what the future holds for them all.
