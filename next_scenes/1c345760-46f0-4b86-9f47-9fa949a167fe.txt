Jenna is at the front of the stage, surrounded by her friends. They are all cheering and clapping along to the music. The sun is just beginning to rise, and the stage is lit up with spotlights. The band is playing their hearts out, and Jenna is having the time of her life. She is dancing and singing along to the music, and she can't believe how lucky she is to be at the concert.
