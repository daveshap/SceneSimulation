Swathi yawns and stretches as she wakes up, then climbs out of bed and goes to the window. She looks out at the beautiful countryside, bathed in the warm glow of the rising sun. Birds are singing in the trees, and a light breeze stirs the leaves. She takes a deep breath of the fresh morning air, then goes to the kitchen to start her day. After breakfast, she goes outside to tend to her garden. She hums to herself as she works, enjoying the peacefulness of the morning. She hears a rustling in the bushes and stops, alert. A moment later, a rabbit hops out and scurries away. She laughs and goes back to work. Suddenly, she hears shouting in the distance. She stands up and listens, trying to make out the words. It sounds like someone is in trouble. She hurriedly gathers her things and starts running towards the noise. As she gets closer, she can see that a group of people are surrounding someone. She can't see who it is, but she can tell they're in trouble. She starts to run faster, but before she can reach them, they're gone. She stops, panting, and looks around. There's no sign of them anywhere. She stands there for a moment, trying to catch her breath, then decides to go back home. She doesn't know what was going on, but she knows it isn't safe. She'll have to tell the others what she saw.
