Mashawn slowly approaches the bushes, heart pounding in his chest. He parts the leaves and sees a young gazelle, its leg caught in a trap. The gazelle is bleeding and in pain, and its frantic cries are echoing through the silent evening. Mashawn knows he can't leave the gazelle to suffer. He quickly springs into action, using his knife to cut the gazelle's leg free from the trap. He carefully applies pressure to the wound to stop the bleeding and comforts the terrified animal until it calms down. Mashawn knows he can't just leave the gazelle here. It's too weak to walk, and the predators will be out soon. So, he scooped the gazelle into his arms and started the long walk to the nearest vet. It's going to be a long night, but Mashawn knows he's made the right decision.
