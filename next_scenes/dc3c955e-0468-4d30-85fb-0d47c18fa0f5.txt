The men surrounded Gabbi, closing in on her. She tried to back away, but she was up against the cold metal of the Eiffel Tower. One of the men reached out and grabbed her, his hand groping her breast. Gabbi screamed and tried to pull away, but there was nowhere to go. The other men started to jeer and laugh, egging the first man on. He pulled Gabbi closer, his hand slipping down to her waist. Gabbi tried to knee him in the groin, but he was holding her too tight. She felt helpless and terrified as the man started to force her legs apart. She knew what was going to happen, and she screamed and fought as hard as she could. But it was no use. The man was too strong. She felt his hand rip her underwear off as he forced himself inside her. The pain was unbearable, and she screamed and sobbed as he kept pounding into her. The other men were still jeering and laughing, egging him on. Gabbi felt like she was going to vomit, and she begged the man to stop. But he paid her no heed. He just kept going, until he finally reached his climax. Gabbi was left sobbing on the ground, her ripped clothing and bruised body a testament to the horror she had just endured.
