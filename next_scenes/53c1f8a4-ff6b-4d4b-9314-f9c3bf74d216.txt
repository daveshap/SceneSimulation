Jenna is running as fast as she can, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear the bear crashing through the woods behind her, but she doesn't dare look back. She knows she has to make it to the road. If she can just make it to the road, someone will see her and help her. She's almost there. She can see the road up ahead. She's almost to safety. And then she feels a sharp pain in her leg. The bear has caught up to her. She screams as the bear drags her into the woods. She tries to fight, but it's no use. The bear is too strong. She feels her body being ripped apart as the bear starts to eat her. There's nothing she can do. She's going to die.
