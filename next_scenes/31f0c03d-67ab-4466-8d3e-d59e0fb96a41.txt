Aleksy stayed with the woman until the ambulance arrived, doing his best to keep her calm and comfortable. He rode in the back with her to the hospital, holding her hand and coaching her through each contraction. When they arrived at the hospital, Aleksy helped the paramedics wheel her into the delivery room. He waited outside, pacing back and forth anxiously. After what felt like hours, a doctor finally came out to see him. Aleksy's heart sank when he saw the doctor's somber expression. The woman had lost too much blood and there was nothing they could do. Aleksy was devastated. He had tried to help, but in the end, he was powerless. He turned and walked away from the hospital, his head hanging low.
