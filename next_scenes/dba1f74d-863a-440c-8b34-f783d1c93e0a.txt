Bob leans back against the door, heart pounding in his chest. His hands are shaking and he feels a little unsteady on his feet. It takes him a moment to catch his breath and compose himself. He turns back to the counter, where the remains of the bottle are still oozing bourbon. Bob sighs and starts to clean up the mess. He's got the bar swept and mopped in no time, and he's just starting to restock the shelves when he hears the sound of breaking glass. Bob freezes, heart sinking. He knows all too well what that sound means. He grabs the bat and heads for the door. As he swings it open, he's met with a scene of chaos. The drunken man is in the middle of the street, throwing rocks and bottles at cars and pedestrians alike. Bob watches in disbelief as the man staggers around, yelling and causing havoc. He knows he should call the police, but he can't bring himself to do it. He can't just stand by and watch this man destroy himself. Bob feels a sudden surge of courage and he stride out into the street. "Hey!" he shouts. "You need to stop this!" The man turns to him, a wild look in his eyes. Bob takes a step back, but he stands his ground. "Come on, let's go back inside and get you sobered up." The man just laughs and throws another rock. It narrowly misses Bob's head and shatters the window of a nearby car. Bob knows he's in over his head. He turns and sprints back to the safety of the coffee shop. He grabs his phone and dials 911. As he waits for the police to arrive, he can hear the man's drunken shouts fading into the distance.
