Mashawn continues working on the construction site, breaking up concrete with his jackhammer. The noise is still deafening, and he's still sweating profusely. He takes another sip of water from his canteen and looks around. He sees the other workers, some operating machinery, some lugging heavy loads of materials. He hears a loud roar and looks up to see a lion walking across the site. Everyone stops what they're doing and watches as the lion calmly strolls through the construction site. After a few minutes, the lion moves on and everyone goes back to work. Mashawn picks up his jackhammer and resumes breaking up the concrete.
