Tom arrives home from his shift at the bar and unlocks the door. He walks into the apartment and takes off his shoes. He walks into the living room and sees his girlfriend on the couch, watching TV. He knows he needs to apologize to her, but he's not sure how. He walks into the kitchen and gets a drink of water. He leans against the counter and looks at his girlfriend. He decides to go talk to her. He walks into the living room and sits down on the couch next to her. He looks at her and starts to speak, but she interrupts him. She tells him that she's sorry for what she said earlier and she doesn't want to fight. Tom tells her that he's sorry too. They hug and make up. Tom goes to bed and falls asleep.
