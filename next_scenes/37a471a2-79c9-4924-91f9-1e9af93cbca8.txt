The elevator doors open, and Wang steps out into the lobby. He walks across the lobby to the front door, and presses the button to buzz himself out. After a moment, the door unlocks, and Wang steps out into the cool evening air. He walks back to his van, and climbs inside. He starts the engine, and pulls out of the parking spot. He drives out of the parking lot and onto the street, heading back towards the warehouse. He makes a few turns, and eventually arrives at the warehouse. He pulls up to the loading dock and parks the van. He climbs out of the van and stretches his arms, yawning. He walks into the warehouse, and over to the time clock. He punches out, and then heads towards the locker room. He changes out of his work clothes and into his street clothes. He grabs his bag and heads towards the exit. He waves to the security guard as he walks out of the warehouse, and then he is on his way.
