Jenna is so cold that she can't stop shaking. She's tried everything to stay warm, but she's starting to feel lightheaded and she knows she won't be able to last much longer. She's starting to think about her family and how much she loves them. She's also thinking about how she's going to die if she doesn't find a way to get warm soon. She's so lost in thought that she doesn't hear the door open. She doesn't realize that someone has come to help her until she feels a warm blanket being wrapped around her. She looks up to see her husband's worried face. He helps her to her feet and leads her out of the building. He takes her home and puts her to bed, and she falls into a deep sleep.
