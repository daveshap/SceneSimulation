Swathi watches the sun dip below the horizon, and she can't help but feel a sense of peace settle over her. She's grateful for her happy life, but she can't help but feel a little bit lonely sometimes. She gazes out at the water, her mind calm and at ease. This is her happy place, where she can just be herself and feel at peace with the world. The waves continue to lap against the shore, and Swathi eventually gets up and starts to walk back to her house. She takes her time, savoring the feeling of the sand between her toes and the cool breeze blowing in her hair. She knows that she'll have to return to the real world soon enough, but for now, she's just happy to enjoy this moment of peace.
