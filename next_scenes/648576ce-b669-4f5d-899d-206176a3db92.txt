Mashawn stops in his tracks, frozen with fear at the sight of the jaguar. His heart is pounding in his chest and he can feel the sweat on his forehead. He knows he needs to turn and run the other way, but his body won't move. The jaguar starts to prowl closer, its eyes fixed on Mashawn. He can see the hunger in the animal's eyes and knows he is in trouble. Suddenly, the jaguar leaps at him, knocking him to the ground. Mashawn tries to scream, but the air is knocked out of him. He feels the jaguar's teeth sinking into his flesh and knows his end is near. There is a flash of light and then everything goes black.
