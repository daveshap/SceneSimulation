The band finishes their set and the crowd goes wild. Mashawn is on his feet, clapping and cheering along with everyone else. The band takes a bow and exits the stage. The crowd starts to disperse, but Mashawn lingers, not ready to leave just yet. He's lost in thought, replaying the highlights of the concert in his mind. Suddenly, he's brought back to reality by a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see a smiling woman. She's holding out a piece of paper. "I hope you don't mind me bothering you, but I saw you watching the band and I thought you might like this." she says, handing him the paper. Mashawn takes it from her, unfolding it to reveal a hand-drawn picture of the band. It's rough, but he can tell it's good. "Thank you, this is amazing." he says, genuinely touched. The woman beams with pride. "I'm glad you like it. I'm Ana, by the way." "Mashawn. It's nice to meet you, Ana." He tucks the drawing into his pocket and Ana says her goodbye. Mashawn watches her walk away, then looks back at the stage, still empty but now with a new meaning.
