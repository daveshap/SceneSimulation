Jenna's mother gets up from the bench and walks over to Jenna. She sits down next to her and puts her arm around her. They sit in silence for a moment, gazing up at the Eiffel Tower. Jenna's mother then speaks, "Jenna, this is going to be a great year for you. I can feel it." Jenna smiles and nods. "I know, Mom. I can't wait to see what the future holds."
