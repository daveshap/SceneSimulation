The astronauts on the International Space Station are amazed that Swathi has been able to establish a communication link with them using only her laptop and a satellite dish. They eagerly answer all of her questions about their work and life in space. Swathi is thrilled to be able to talk to real astronauts and to learn about their experiences. She is especially interested in hearing about the challenges they face while living and working in space. After a while, the conversation starts to die down and Swathi realizes that she should probably let the astronauts get back to work. She says her goodbyes and thanks them for their time. Swathi is on Cloud Nine as she disconnects the satellite dish and starts to pack up her things. She can't believe that she was actually able to talk to the International Space Station. It is an experience that she will treasure forever.
