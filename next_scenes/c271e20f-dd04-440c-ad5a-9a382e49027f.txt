Tom looks at his watch and then out the window, seeing the sun just peeking over the horizon. He yawns and stretches his arms, looking around the empty bar. He can hear the occasional hiss of escaping air from a crack in the floor. It's been slow lately, and Tom is hoping for a busy day. He hears the sound of footsteps on the gravel outside and he smiles, walking to the door to greet his first customer of the day.
