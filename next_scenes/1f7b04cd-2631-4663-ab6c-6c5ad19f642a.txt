Joe rushes into the shop, out of breath and sweating. "Bob, we've got a problem. The catering company messed up the order, and we're short a lot of coffee. Can you help us out?" Bob doesn't even hesitate - he knows what needs to be done. "Of course, Joe. Just let me get started on a pot. It's going to be a long day, but I'm happy to help out." He starts grinding beans and measuring out water, getting everything ready to make a giant pot of coffee. He knows it won't be easy, but he's happy to help his friends. And he knows that, at the end of it all, there will be a great concert to enjoy.
