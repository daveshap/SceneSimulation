Jenna and her friends are at the after-party, which is being held at a nearby bar. They're all sitting around a table, drinking and chatting. Jenna is telling them about how she was so close to the stage, she could've reached out and touched the band members. Her friends are impressed, and they all wish they could've been there with her. They continue to drink and chat for a while, and then they decide to head out. Jenna is a little buzzed from the alcohol, but she's not too drunk. They all say their goodbyes and head in different directions. Jenna is walking home, and she's feeling good.She's a little sad that the concert is over, but she's also happy that she got to experience it. She's looking forward to the next one.
