Gabbi's eyes slowly drift closed as she begins to doze off. She's only half-aware of the sounds of the children stirring in their beds. A soft snore escapes her lips as she slips into a light sleep. Suddenly, Gabbi's eyes snap open as she hears a loud bang outside. She bolts upright in bed, her heart racing. For a moment, she just sits there, frozen in fear. Then, mustering up all her courage, she slowly gets up and goes to the window. Peering out, her eyes widen in terror as she sees a giant meteoric crashing towards the moon's surface. She watches in horror as it collides with the ground, creating a huge explosion. Gabbi stumbles backwards as the ground trembles beneath her feet. She quickly gathers the children and presses them close to her, trying to shield them from the terror unfolding outside. They cling to her, whimpering in fear. Gabbi can feel her own tears spilling down her cheeks as she watches the end of the world unfold before her eyes. There's nothing she can do but wait and hope that somehow, they all survive this.
