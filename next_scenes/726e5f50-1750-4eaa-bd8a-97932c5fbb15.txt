Mashawn's heart is racing as he starts to run down the mountain, the bear close behind him. He can hear the bear's heavy breathing and the sound of its claws scratching the ground as it runs. Mashawn is terrified, but he doesn't have time to think. He just keeps running. Suddenly, he trips on a rock and falls to the ground. The bear is right on top of him. Mashawn closes his eyes, expecting the worst. But then, he hears the bear turn and start to run back up the mountain. Mashawn opens his eyes and sees that the bear is gone. He can't believe he's still alive. He knows he's lucky to be alive, and he's grateful to be able to walk away from this encounter. But he can't help but feel a little bit shaken as he continues his descent down the mountain.
