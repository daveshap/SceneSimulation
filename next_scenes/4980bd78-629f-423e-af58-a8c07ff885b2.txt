Wang sits in his truck, honking his horn and trying to inch his way through the crowd, but it's impossible. He's finally forced to stop and wait it out until the concert ends. The concert goes on for hours, and the noise is deafening. The crowd is so dense that Wang can't even open his door. He's starting to feel claustrophobic and panicky. He's sweating and his heart is racing. He's never felt so trapped and helpless. Finally, the concert ends and the crowd disperses. Wang is able to drive his truck out of the area and he breathes a sigh of relief.
