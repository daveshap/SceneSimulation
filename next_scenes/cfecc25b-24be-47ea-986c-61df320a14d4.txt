Mashawn was awake for his third consecutive night. His body ached and his eyes burned from the lack of sleep. He was on the verge of dozing off when he heard the noise. At first he thought he was dreaming, but the sound was too loud and persistent to ignore. He grabbed his flashlight and stumbled out of his makeshift bed, tripping over one of the crates he used as a nightstand. He cursed under his breath as he regained his balance and shone his light around the construction site. The sound was coming from the other side of the site, near the storage containers. Mashawn's heart raced as he ran towards the sound, his flashlight bouncing wildly in his hand. As he got closer, he could see a shadowy figure running away from the scene of a recent break-in. Mashawn gave chase, but the figure was too quick and soon disappeared into the darkness. Mashawn returned to the site of the break-in, heart still racing. He shone his flashlight around, trying to see what was taken. It looked like some equipment and supplies were stolen from one of the storage containers. Mashawn cursed the thief and began to search for them, but whoever it was knows the layout of the construction site better than anyone, and they're long gone by the time the search begins.
