Bob slowly regained consciousness, feeling a sharp pain in his throat. He opened his eyes and saw the man looming over him, still clutching him by the throat. "I told you, Bob," the man said in a hoarse, rasping voice. "Give me what I want. Or you will regret it." Bob shook his head weakly, still gasping for air. He didn't know what the man wanted. He didn't have anything. The man's grip tightened, and Bob felt himself losing consciousness again. He knew that he was going to die. He only hoped that someone would find his body before the man did.
