Sandy is sitting at a table outside her home, enjoying a quiet lunch by herself. The day is warm and sunny, and the soft breeze is a welcome relief from the heat. She's surrounded by the sounds of nature; the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves. In the distance, she can hear the sound of children playing and laughter. It's a peaceful moment, and Sandy is enjoying the tranquility. Suddenly, she hears a loud crash. It sounds like something has fallen over inside her house. Sandy gets up quickly, her heart racing as she hurriedly goes inside to see what has happened. She finds that a vase has fallen over and shattered on the floor. Water and flowers are everywhere, and the vase is in pieces. Sandy let out a sigh of relief; it could have been much worse. She starts to clean up the mess, being careful not to cut herself on the broken glass. After a few minutes, she has the area cleaned up and the vase is no more. It was a peaceful moment, but it's over now. Sandy goes back outside to finish her lunch, but the peace and quiet has been shattered.
