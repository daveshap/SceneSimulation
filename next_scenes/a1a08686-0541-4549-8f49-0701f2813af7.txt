The sun continues to beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape. Swathi's head is spinning and she feels like she is going to faint. She tries to scream for help again, but the venom has now spread to her lungs and she cannot make a sound. She starts to panic as she realizes that she is going to die if she does not get help soon. She tries to crawl towards the nearest bushes in an attempt to hide from the snake, but her movements are sluggish and she does not get very far. The snake hisses and strikes at her again, injecting more venom into her system. She feels her body start to go numb and she knows she is losing consciousness. She sees the snake coil itself around her one last time before everything goes black.
