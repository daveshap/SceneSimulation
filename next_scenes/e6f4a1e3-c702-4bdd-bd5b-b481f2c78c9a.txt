The security guard finishes his search of Swathi's office and gives her the all clear. She goes back to her desk and resumes working on her project. A few minutes later, she hears a strange noise coming from the direction of the window. She gets up to investigate and sees that the window is open. She looks out and sees a man climbing down the fire escape. She watches him for a moment, then decides to call the security guard. She picks up the phone and dials the number for security. When the guard arrives, she points out the man to him. The guard thanks her for her help and goes to investigate.
