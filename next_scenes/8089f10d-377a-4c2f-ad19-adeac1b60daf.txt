Tom looks down at the valley and watches as the lights start to come on in the buildings below. He can see a few people walking around, and the sound of laughter carries up to him on the breeze. He looks up at the stars and feels a sense of peace wash over him. It's moments like this that make him love his job as a bartender. He can't think of anywhere he'd rather be than right here, right now. Tom takes a deep breath and starts to head back down the mountain. He knows he has a long hike ahead of him, but he feels refreshed and invigorated after taking a moment to appreciate the beauty around him. As he walks, Tom thinks about all of the people he's met during his time as a bartender. He's heard so many stories and shared so many laughs with the people who come into the bar. He feels lucky to have found a job that he loves so much. Tom reaches the bottom of the mountain and starts to make his way back to the bar. He can't wait to tell his friends about his amazing hike and to share a few laughs with them over a cold beer.
