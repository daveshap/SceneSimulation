Tom: Hello? Caller: Hi, is this Tom? Tom: Speaking. Caller: Hi Tom, this is Sarah from the office upstairs. We're just wondering if you could do us a favor and bring up a few cases of water? We're having a company meeting and we're running low. Tom: Sure, no problem. I'll be right up. Sarah: Thanks, Tom. Tom hangs up the phone and begins loading cases of water onto a dolly. He wheels the dolly out from behind the bar and toward the elevator. Just as he's about to press the call button, the elevator doors open and a group of people step out. Tom recognition one of them as his old boss, Mr. Michaels. Mr. Michaels sees Tom and pauses. Mr. Michaels: Tom, long time no see. How've you been? Tom: I've been good, Mr. Michaels. Thanks for asking. Mr. Michaels: That's great to hear. Listen, I'm in town for a conference and I was hoping to stop by the bar later for a drink. Do you think you could save me a seat? Tom: Absolutely. I'll see you later, Mr. Michaels. Mr. Michaels: Great, see you then. Tom watches as Mr. Michaels and the rest of the group walk away. He can't believe his old boss is in town. He shakes his head and presses the call button for the elevator. A few moments later, the doors open and he wheels the dolly into the elevator. He pushes the button for the office upstairs and leans against the wall as the elevator begins to rise.
