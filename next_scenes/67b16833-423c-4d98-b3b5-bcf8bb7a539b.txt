Swathi continues to pace back and forth in her bedroom, her head in her hands. She looks tired and frustrated, as if she can't believe she's still up in the middle of the night. Every few minutes, she stops and goes to sit at her desk, where her laptop is open. She stares at the screen for a minute or two, then opens up a new document and starts typing furiously. After a few minutes, she closes the document and opens up another one. She repeats this pattern a few more times, until she finally seems to give up and slams her laptop shut. She sits there for a moment, her head in her hands, before getting up and starting to pace again.
