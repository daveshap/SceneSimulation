Aleksy is still standing under the Eiffel Tower, but he has started to notice the people around him. He sees a young couple kissing, an old man feeding the pigeons, and a group of children laughing. He can't help but smile at the happiness around him. He looks back up at the tower and is filled with a sense of peace. He knows he'll always remember this moment.
