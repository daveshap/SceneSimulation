Tom is still in shock as the men leave the bar. He can't believe what just happened. His hands are shaking and he feels like he's going to vomit. The other customers are all in a state of panic. Some are crying, others are trying to call the police. Tom knows he needs to do something, but he's frozen in place. He can't think of what to do. Suddenly, one of the customers takes charge. He tells everyone to calm down and he calls the police. Once the police arrive, they take statements from everyone. Tom tells them what happened and he gives them a description of the men. The police say they'll do everything they can to find the men, but Tom knows it's not going to be enough. He's never going to feel safe in this bar again.
