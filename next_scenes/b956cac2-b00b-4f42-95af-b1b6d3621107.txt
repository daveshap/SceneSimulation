It is now 7pm, and Bob is still trying to attract customers to his coffee shop. He is starting to get very frustrated, and is considering giving up. However, he decides to give it one more try. He walks around the neighborhood, handing out flyers and talking to people. Finally, he seems to have found some interested customers. They come into his shop, and he is able to make some sales. He is very relieved, and is now hopeful that his business will be successful.
