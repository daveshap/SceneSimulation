Sandy is walking down the street, enjoying the sights and sounds of the city. She's not used to being out at night, and the bustle of activity is a bit overwhelming. She's pushing her baby in a stroller, and she can't help but smile at the sight of her sleeping peacefully. Suddenly, Sandy hears a piercing scream. It sounds like it's coming from a nearby alleyway. Without thinking, she rushes towards the sound. She finds a woman cowering in the alley, surrounded by a group of menacing-looking men. The woman is begging for help, and Sandy knows she can't just ignore her. Without hesitating, Sandy runs towards the men and starts yelling at them to leave the woman alone. The men are surprised by her sudden appearance, and they start to back away. Sandy continues to yelled at them, telling them to leave the woman alone. Eventually, the men get fed up and start to walk away. The woman is relieved and thanks Sandy for her help. Sandy is happy that she was able to help, but she can't help but feel a bit shaken by the whole experience.
