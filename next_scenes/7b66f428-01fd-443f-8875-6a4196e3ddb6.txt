Swathi finishes her work for the day and stretches her arms above her head with a yawn. She stands up and stretches her legs, then goes to the kitchen to start dinner. While she's cooking, she hears the sound of leaves rustling outside. She peers out the window and sees a deer walking through the woods. She watches it for a few minutes, then goes back to cooking. After dinner, she cleans up the kitchen and then settles down on the couch with a cup of tea. She turns on the TV and starts flipping through the channels, but there's nothing on that interests her. She clicks the TV off and sets her cup down on the coffee table. She leans back against the couch and closes her eyes, letting out a long sigh. Suddenly, she hears a loud crash outside. She sits up straight and listens, but there's nothing else. She gets up cautiously and goes to the window, but she doesn't see anything. She stands there for a few minutes, but there's no other sound. She shrugs and goes back to the couch, turning on the TV again.
