Mashawn climbs down the beam, his hands and feet numbed by the cold. He takes each step carefully, making sure not to slip. The climb down is just as treacherous as the climb up, and more than once Mashawn slips and nearly falls. But he finally makes it back to the ground safely. He looks up at the tower, its steel beams cold and unforgiving in the night sky. He wonders why he's drawn to the top of the tower, but he knows he can't stay there forever. He has to get back down before anyone sees him. It's not safe to be up there, and he could get in a lot of trouble if he's caught. So he takes one last look at the view and then starts the long walk back to his dorm.
