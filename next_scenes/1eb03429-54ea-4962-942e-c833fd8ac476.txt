Aleksy heads out the door of his apartment, key in hand. He locks the door behind him, then pocketing the key, he turns and heads down the stairs. He's not sure where he's going, he just knows he has to get out of the house. He reaches the bottom of the stairs and exits the building, then begins walking down the street. He walks for a block before coming to a stop at a busy intersection. He looks around, then crosses the street. He continues walking, not really paying attention to where he's going. He's in a daze, just trying to clear his head. He doesn't know how long he's been walking, but he eventually finds himself in front of a park. He looks around, then heads for a bench and sits down. He leans back and closes his eyes, letting out a long sigh.
