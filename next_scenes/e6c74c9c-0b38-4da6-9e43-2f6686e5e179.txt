Mashawn lay on the ground, blood oozing from his wounds. He felt lightheaded and dizzy, and everything was starting to fade to black. He could hear the jaguar prowling around in the bushes, apparently not yet satisfied with its kill. Mashawn knew he had to act fast if he wanted to survive. He tried to get to his feet, but his legs wouldn't support him. He stumbled and fell back to the ground with a groan. The jaguar heard him and came stalking out of the bushes. It approached him slowly, its eyes glittering with hunger. Mashawn knew he was done for. There was no way he could fight off the big cat. He closed his eyes and said a silent prayer, waiting for the end. Suddenly, he heard a loud screeching noise. The jaguar let out a yelp of pain and terror. Mashawn opened his eyes to see a huge bird swooping down on the cat, its talons outstretched. The bird snatched up the jaguar in its powerful claws and flew off into the sky, disappearing into the dense foliage. Mashawn lay on the ground, stunned. He couldn't believe what had just happened. He had been certain that he was going to die, but somehow he had been saved. He didn't know how to thank his mysterious savior, but he was grateful nonetheless.
