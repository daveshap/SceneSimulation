Jenna is shaking uncontrollably as she tries to radio for help. Her hands are trembling so badly, she can barely press the buttons. She finally manages to radio for help, but she's not sure anyone will hear her. She's so far from home, and she's never felt so scared before. She's never been so alone. Jenna sits in the darkness, waiting for help to arrive. She's still shaking, and she's starting to feel a bit dizzy. She's starting to feel light-headed. She's never felt so scared before. She's starting to feel like she's going to pass out. She's never been so scared in her life.
