Aleksy is happy to be heading home early from his grocery store shift. The night sky is beautiful and he feels thankful for the moment of peace. When he arrives home, his cat greets him and he gives her a scoop of food. He then heads to the kitchen to make himself a simple dinner. After eating, he settles down in front of the fireplace with a book. He can hear the sounds of the animals outside, which makes him feel even more at peace with the world.
