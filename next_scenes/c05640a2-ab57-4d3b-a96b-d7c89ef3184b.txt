The music changes to a slower song and Jenna's friends start to pair up, leaving her alone. She tries to enjoy the music, but she feels a bit left out and awkward standing there by herself. She starts to head towards the exit, but someone grabs her hand and pulls her back. She looks up to see a tall, handsome stranger who starts to slow dance with her. She's a bit hesitant at first, but she gets lost in his eyes and ends up having a great time.
