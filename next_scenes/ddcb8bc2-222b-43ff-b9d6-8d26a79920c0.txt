Bob finishes cleaning up the shop and heads to the back room to get ready for bed. He undresses and climbs into bed, but he can't seem to fall asleep. He keeps thinking about the two hikers he saw earlier. He wonders what they could have been up to. After a while, he gets up and decides to take a walk. He grabs a flashlight and heads out the back door. He walks to the edge of the property and looks up at the mountain. He can see the lights of the town below, but everything is quiet. He shines his flashlight up the mountain, but he doesn't see any hikers. He decides to head up the trail a ways to see if he can find them. He's only been hiking for a few minutes when he comes across the first hiker. They're lying on the ground, and it looks like they've been attacked. Bob can see wounds on their arms and legs, and there's blood everywhere. He shine his flashlight around, but he doesn't see anyone else. He starts to feel uneasy, and he decides to head back to town.
