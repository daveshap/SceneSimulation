Jenna's heart is pounding in her chest as she walks quickly through the dark forest. She is sweating profusely and her nerves are on edge. She keep glancing over her shoulder, convinced that she is being followed. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap. She freezes in her tracks and looks around wildly. She sees a large, dark shape moving towards her. She opens her mouth to scream, but before she can make a sound, the dark shape is upon her. Jenna feels herself being lifted off the ground and she is carried away into the darkness. She kicks and screams, but it is futile. She is gone, lost to the darkness forever.
