Aleksy wakes up to the sound of birds chirping outside the window. He stretches and yawns, feeling well-rested after a good night's sleep. He gets out of bed and walks over to the window, peeking out at the view. The sun is just starting to come up over the mountains, and the air is still chilly. Aleksy shivers and rubs his hands together, wondering if he should start a fire or try to find something to eat. He's just starting to feel hungry, but he's not sure if he's up for a hike down the mountain just yet. He decides to wait a little while longer, and see if he can find anything in the cabin that might be edible. He starts going through the cupboards, but all he finds are some old cans of food that have been there for years. He looks in the fridge, but it's empty. There's a pot on the stove, and he fills it with water from the sink, wondering if he should try to cook something. He's just starting to feel really hungry, and he decides to give it a try. He rummages through the cupboards again and finds a can of beans. He opens it and dumps the beans into the pot of water, then puts it on the stove to cook. While the beans are cooking, he looks around the cabin for something to eat them with. He finds a loaf of bread that's starting to get stale, but it will have to do. He sets the table and sits down to eat his breakfast, feeling grateful to have a warm meal.
