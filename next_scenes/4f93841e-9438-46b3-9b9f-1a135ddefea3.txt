Sandy is walking quickly now, her heart racing as she tries to put distance between herself and the group of people. She can feel their eyes on her, boring into her back, and she can sense their suspicion. She is a Muslim, after all, and they undoubtedly think she is the enemy. The hate and bigotry in their voices is palpable, and Sandy is reeling from the encounter. She feels like she can't catch her breath, and she is on the verge of tears. She knows she needs to get away from here before she completely breaks down. She senses someone following her and she quickens her pace, but she is too slow. The man catches up to her and grabs her arm, spinning her around to face him. "What do you know about the attack?" he demands, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. Sandy is terrified, and she can feel herself shaking. She knows she needs to say something, but she is frozen in fear.
