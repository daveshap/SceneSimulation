Wang arrives at the remote village, his truck loaded with supplies. He's relieved to have made it safely, but his relief is short-lived. He sees a group of men approaching, armed with guns. He knows he's in trouble. He tries to start the truck and drive away, but it's too late. The men are upon him, demanding money and supplies. Wang pleads with them, but they don't listen. They rough him up, taking whatever they want. They leave him there, beaten and bloody. Wang knows he's lucky to be alive. He gathers what's left of his supplies and makes his way to the village, where he'll get help.
