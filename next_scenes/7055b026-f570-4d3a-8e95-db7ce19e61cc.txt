Aleksy can't take his eyes off the woman as she walks away. He's never seen anyone so beautiful, and he can't believe she was just talking to him. He lies back down and looks up at the sky, trying to calm his racing heart. He's sure he must be dreaming, but it was the most realistic dream he's ever had. He can still see Lily's face in his mind, and he can't wait to see her again. He closes his eyes and imagines what it would be like to kiss her. He can feel her soft lips on his, and the dream is so real that he can almost taste her. Suddenly, he feels someone's hand on his shoulder, and he jumps. He opens his eyes and sees Lily standing over him, smiling. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you," she says. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You looked like you were having a nightmare." Aleksy shakes his head. "It wasn't a nightmare. It was the best dream I've ever had." Lily smiles and extends her hand to help him up. "Come on," she says. "Let's go for a walk." Aleksy takes her hand, and they start walking down the beach. He can't believe this is really happening. It feels like a dream, but he knows it's real. He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure that Lily is the woman he's been looking for.
