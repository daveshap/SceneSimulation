The sun sets behind the trees, casting a pink and orange glow on the sky. Gabbi watches as the children play, their laughter filling the air. She feels a sense of peace and contentment in this moment, surrounded by the beauty of nature. As the sky grows darker, Gabbi hears the sound of a car coming up the road. She knows the children's parents will be home soon, and she begins to gather their things. The car pulls into the driveway, and the children run to meet their parents. Gabbi gives them a hug and says goodbye, then watches as they drive away. She takes a deep breath of the cool evening air and smiles, knowing she has helped create some wonderful memories for the family.
