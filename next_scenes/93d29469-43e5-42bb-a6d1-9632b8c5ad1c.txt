Bob went home that night feeling defeated. He couldn't stop thinking about the woman and her lost wedding ring. He felt terrible that he couldn't find it for her. He decided to take another walk on the beach, in the hopes that he might find the ring. He searched for hours, but he still didn't find it. He was about to give up when he saw something shining in the sand. He bent down and picked it up. It was the woman's wedding ring. He was so excited that he had found it. He started running back to her house, hoping he would find her there. When he got there, he knocked on the door and the woman's husband answered. Bob told him that he had found the ring and he handed it to him. The husband was so grateful. He invited Bob in for a cup of coffee. Bob accepted and they sat down to chat. The husband told Bob that his wife had been devastated when she lost her ring. Bob said that he understood how she felt, because he would feel the same way if he lost his own wedding ring. The husband thanked Bob again for finding the ring and invited him to come by the coffee shop anytime. Bob said he would, and then he went home.
