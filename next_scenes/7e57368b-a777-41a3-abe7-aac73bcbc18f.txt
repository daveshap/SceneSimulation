Gabbi continues to walk through the dark forest, holding the baby in her arms. She's getting tired and the baby is getting fussy. She's not sure where she is or how she's going to get out of the forest. She keeps walking, hoping to find a way out. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. She looks around, trying to see what it is. It sounds like something is following her. She starts to run, but she's not sure which way to go. The noise gets louder and she starts to panic. She doesn't know what to do. Suddenly, she sees a light up ahead. It looks like there's a way out of the forest. She starts to run towards the light, but she's not sure if it's safe. The noise is still following her, but she doesn't care. She has to get out of the Forest. She reaches the light and finds herself in a clearing. She's finally out of the Forest. She looks back, but she can't see the way she came. She's not sure how she's going to get back home. But she's relieved to be out of the Forest.
