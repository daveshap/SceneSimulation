Aleksy wakes up to the sound of his own labored breathing. His head feels like it's about to split open, and there's a sharp pain in his side. He tries to sit up, but the world starts spinning and he has to lie back down. He's disoriented and confused, trying to remember what happened. Suddenly, it all comes rushing back to him. The impact, the pain, the fear. He remembers seeing the object coming towards him, and then everything went black. Aleksy looks around, trying to get his bearings. He's lying in a crater, and his helmet is cracked. He can see the oxygen leaking out, and he knows he doesn't have much time. He has to find help before he runs out of air. He tries to stand up, but his legs are weak and shaking. He starts to stumble towards the nearest airlock, but he knows he won't make it. He falls to his knees, gasping for breath, and he knows this is the end.
