Mashawn takes a break from drilling and looks around the half-finished office building. He's been working the night shift for weeks now, and he's starting to get tired. The building is mostly empty, and the only sound is the echo of his power drill. He's surrounded by piles of rubble and dust. His hard hat and reflector vest are covered in sweat. He takes a moment to rest and wipe the sweat from his brow. He looks at his drill battery and wonders how much longer he has to work. He's starting to get thirsty, so he goes to the water cooler to get a drink. As he's drinking, he hears a noise coming from the other side of the building. He turns off his drill and listens. He hears footsteps and someone talking. He's not sure who it is, but he knows he's not alone in the building. He grabs his drill and starts to make his way towards the noise. As he gets closer, he realizes that the noise is coming from a group of people. They're all wearing hard hats and reflector vests. He asks them what they're doing in the building. They tell him they're the night shift crew. They've been working on the building for weeks. Mashawn is surprised to hear this. He thought he was the only one working the night shift. The crew tells him that they've been working on the other side of the building. They invite him to join them, and he accepted.
