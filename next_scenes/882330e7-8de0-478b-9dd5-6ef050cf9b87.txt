Bob's vision started to blur and he could feel himself slipping away. He could hear the woman still screaming, but it sounded distant now. He tried to summon the strength to get up, but his body was unresponsive. He could feel the warm blood still flowing from his wound, and he knew he was in serious trouble. He tried to cry out for help, but his voice was weak and barely audible. He could hear the sound of footsteps running away, getting softer and softer until they faded into the distance. And then everything went black.
