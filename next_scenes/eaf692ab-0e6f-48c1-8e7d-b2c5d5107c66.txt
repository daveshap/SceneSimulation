As Jenna turns around to see the large, dark object, her heart races and she start to feel anxious. She starts to back away slowly, not knowing what this object is or what it might do to her. The object continues to rise up out of the crater and Jenna can see that it is some kind of creature. It is large and black, with long limbs and a body that seems to be made of rock. Jenna is terrified as she backs away from the creature. She trips on a rock and falls to the ground, screaming. The creature looms over her, its large black body blocking out the stars and the moon. Jenna is too scared to move, and she simply lays there, whimpering in fear.
