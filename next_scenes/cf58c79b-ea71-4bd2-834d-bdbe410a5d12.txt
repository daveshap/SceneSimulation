Jenna woke up the next morning to the sound of birds chirping outside the window. The sun was shining, and the view was just as breathtaking as the day before. She got out of bed and stretched, then made her way outside. She exploring the area around the cabin, and found a small stream nearby. She followed the stream until she came to a small waterfall. The water was cold, but it felt good on her skin. She sat down on a rock and watched the water for a while, then decided to head back to the cabin. When Jenna got back to the cabin, she made a fire in the fireplace and started to cook breakfast. As she was cooking, she heard a noise outside. She went to the window and saw a bear wandering around the area. She watched it for a while, then went back to cooking breakfast. After she ate, she packed her things and started to head back down the mountain.
