Mashawn walks back to the construction site, his mind full of the happy scene he just left behind. He can't help but contrast it with the gritty reality of the construction site. The sun is still shining, but the construction workers are toiling away in the heat, their faces streaked with sweat and dust. Mashawn feels a pang of guilt as he thinks about how hard they must be working, while he was enjoying his lunch break. He knows he needs to get back to work, but he can't help but feel grateful for the happy moment he just experienced.
