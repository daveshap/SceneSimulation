Tom quickened his pace as he exited the building, his mind still racing with the thoughts of someone following him. He hurried down the street, glancing over his shoulder every few seconds, but there was still no one there. He was just about to turn the corner when he heard footsteps behind him. This time, when he turned around, there was someone there. A tall, shadowy figure was standing just a few feet away from him, not moving or saying a word. Tom's heart raced as he slowly backed away, his mind frantically searching for a way to escape. He turned and ran in the opposite direction, but the figure seemed to glide effortlessly after him. Tom could hear its breathing, steadily getting closer and closer as it pursuit. Just as it was about to catch up to him, Tom felt something hard and cold touch the back of his neck and everything went black.
