Tom walks home from the bar, taking the long way so he can enjoy the views of the Eiffel Tower at night. He loves his job, and he's grateful to have such a beautiful workplace. He's looking forward to tomorrow, when he'll get to do it all again. When he gets home, he takes off his apron and hangs it up, then he washes his hands and face. He changes into his pyjamas and climbs into bed, feeling happy and content. He's soon asleep, dreaming of serving drinks to happy customers under the twinkling lights of the Eiffel Tower.
