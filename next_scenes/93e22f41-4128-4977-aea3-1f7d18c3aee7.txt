Wang climbs back into his truck, ready to head back down the mountain. He's exhausted from the long drive, and the narrow, winding road is treacherous in the dark. He takes a deep breath and starts the engine, making his way slowly down the mountain. He's concentrating hard, trying not to think about the sheer drop-off next to the road. Suddenly, he hears a loud bang. The truck lurches to the side and starts to careen off the road. Wang fights to keep control, but it's hopeless. The truck goes over the edge of the cliff and plummets into the darkness below.
