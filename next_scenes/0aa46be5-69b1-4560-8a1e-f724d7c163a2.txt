The next morning, Swathi wakes early and goes for a walk. She sees impalas, gazelles, and even a lioness stalking her prey. She's careful to stay out of the way and not disturb the animals. She knows this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and she doesn't want to miss a thing. She spends the whole day walking and observing the animals. She even sees a baby elephant being born. It's a miraculous sight and she's filled with wonder. She feels so lucky to have been able to witness it. As the sun starts to set, she heads back to the lodge. She's exhausted but it's been the best day of her life.
