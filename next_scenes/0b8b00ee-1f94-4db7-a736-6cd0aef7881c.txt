Bob makes his way through the streets of Paris, admiring the architecture as he goes. He's lived in the city for years, and he knows every corner of it like the back of his hand. He's on his way to the market to stock up on supplies for his coffee shop, but he can't help but stop and admire the view. The Eiffel Tower looms overhead, its steel frame towering into the sky. The morning sun casts a long shadow across the ground, and the few people around are hurrying to their destinations. After a moment, Bob shakes himself out of his reverie and continue on his way. He arrives at the market and begins browsing the stalls, picking out the freshest produce and chatting with the vendors. He's built up a good rapport with them over the years, and they always give him a good price. He bags up his purchases and heads back to his coffee shop, looking forward to starting the day.
