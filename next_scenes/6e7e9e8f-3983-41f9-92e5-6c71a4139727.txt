After the detective drives away, Sandy goes back inside and tries to resume her lunch preparations. However, she is now feeling rattled and unsettled by the unexpected visit. She kept thinking about the detective's questions and whether she might have seen or heard something that could be helpful in his investigation. However, she could not think of anything that seemed suspicious. After a few minutes, Sandy hears the sound of another car engine outside. She looks out the window and sees that it is the detective's car. He has pulled over to the side of the road and is getting out. Sandy watches as he starts to walk towards the woods. She wonders what he could be doing. After a few minutes, Sandy can't stand the suspense any longer. She puts on her coat and boots and heads out the door to see what the detective is up to. She walks quietly through the woods, following the sound of the detective's footsteps. Suddenly, she hears voices. The detective is talking to someone. Sandy can't see who it is, but she can tell that the other person is female. She tries to get closer to hear what they are saying, but she trips on a branch and makes a noise. The detective and the other person both look in her direction. The woman starts to run away, and the detective gives chase. Sandy gets up and tries to follow them, but she loses sight of them in the trees. She walks back to the cottage, wondering what she has just witnessed.
