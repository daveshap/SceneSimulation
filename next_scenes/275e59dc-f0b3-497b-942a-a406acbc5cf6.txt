Bob watches the last of the tourists walk away before heading back into his coffee shop. He's glad he was able to help them out and hopes they'll remember his shop when they come back to Paris. He's looking forward to a busy day tomorrow, but for now, he's going to close up shop and head home. He's been working hard lately and could use a good night's sleep. Bob sets about closing up the shop, turning off the lights and setting the alarm. He's just about to lock the door when he notices a group of teenagers walking by. They look like they're up to no good and he doesn't want them loitering around his shop. He calls out to them, telling them to move along. They give him a dirty look but eventually wander off. Bob locks the door and heads home for the night.
