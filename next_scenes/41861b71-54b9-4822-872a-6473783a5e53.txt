Aleksy finishes his lunch and pack up his bag. He stands up from the large rock and dusts off his pants. He takes one last look at the view before heading back down the mountain. As he walks, he thinks about the woman he just met and her interesting job. He's never thought about being a goat herder before, but it does seem like a tough but rewarding job. He wonders if he could ever do something like that. He reaches the bottom of the mountain and starts walking towards town. He has a lot to think about, and is looking forward to getting home and talking to his wife about it.
