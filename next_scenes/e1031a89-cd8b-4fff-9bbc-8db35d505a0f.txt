Sandy starts the long walk back down the mountain, her mind racing with all the thoughts and emotions she's experienced over the past few hours. She's definitely not ready to go back to the lodge and face reality just yet, but she knows she can't stay up here forever. As she walks, she takes one last look back at the setting sun, now a glowing orb on the horizon. She pauses for a moment, admiring the way the colors have changed since she was last up here. The sky is now a deep purple, and the stars are starting to come out. She can see the lights of the village in the distance, and she's reminded of all the people down there who are going through their own struggles. She takes a deep breath and starts the descent, feeling grateful for the peace and beauty of her surroundings, even if it is only for a little while.
