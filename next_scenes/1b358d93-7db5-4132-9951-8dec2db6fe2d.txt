The security guard helped Wang to the first aid station where he was given some water and a place to sit down. Wang gulped down the water and tried to catch his breath. His heart was still racing and he felt a little lightheaded but he was starting to feel better. The security guard told him to take it easy for a few minutes and then he would be on his way. Wang nodded and leaned back against the wall. He closed his eyes and tried to calm down. After a few minutes, he felt well enough to stand up and he slowly made his way out of the first aid station. He could see the crowd still dancing and singing but he didn't feel like going back in. He slowly made his way through the crowd and out of the arena. He was relieved to be out of there and he thanked the security guard for his help.
