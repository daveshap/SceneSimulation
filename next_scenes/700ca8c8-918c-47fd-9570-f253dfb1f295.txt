Wang's screams echo through the dark forest as he is pulled into the darkness by the creature. His delivery truck is left abandoned at the side of the road. The creature drags Wang deeper into the woods, towards its lair. Wang continues to scream and struggle, but it is no use. The creature finally reaches its lair and sinks its teeth into Wang's flesh. Wang screams in pain as he is devoured by the creature.
