The sun continues to rise, and the sky turns from a fiery red to a brilliantly blue. Swathi can see the mist slowly dissipating from the mountaintop, revealing the lush green landscape below. She can see for miles in all directions, and the view is truly breathtaking. The air is crisp and clean, and she can feel the freshness of it fill her lungs. She takes a deep breath and savors the moment. It's going to be a beautiful day.
