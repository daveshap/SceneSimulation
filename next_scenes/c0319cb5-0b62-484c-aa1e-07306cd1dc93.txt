Bob is sitting in his coffee shop, enjoying a cup of coffee and watching the Earth rotate slowly in the sky. He loves his quiet life on the moon, and he can't imagine living anywhere else. Suddenly, the door to the shop opens and a customer comes in. Bob greets the customer warmly and asks what he can get for him. The customer asks for a cup of coffee, and Bob gets to work making it. As he does, he chatters happily with the customer, telling him about his life on the moon and how much he loves it. The customer seems interested in Bob's story, and he asks questions about what it's like to live on the moon. Bob enjoys talking with the customer, and he soon forgets that he was watching the Earth rotate. Instead, he and the customer spend the rest of the evening talking and enjoying each other's company.
