Sandy lay in the alleyway, crying and shaking. She couldn't believe what had just happened to her. She felt dirty and violated, and she knew she would never be the same again. She tried to get up, but her legs wouldn't support her. She ended up crawling to the entrance of the alleyway, where she collapsed. She lay there for a few minutes, trying to gather her strength. Finally, she was able to stand. She walked back to her hotel, her dress still around her waist. She was in shock, and she could barely think straight. When she got to her room, she locked the door and collapsed on the bed. She lay there for hours, crying and shaking, until finally she fell into a fitful sleep.
