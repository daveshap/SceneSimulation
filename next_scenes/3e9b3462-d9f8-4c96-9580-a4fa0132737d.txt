Aleksy felt the cat's breath on the back of his neck as it closed in for the kill. He knew he was about to die, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. The cat's claws dug into his flesh as it toppled him to the ground. Aleksy felt the sharp teeth sink into his neck, and he knew it was all over. There was a moment of pain, and then everything went black. Aleksy was dead.
