Wang drives slowly and carefully, keeping an eye out for any sign of danger. He's getting close to his final destination, when he sees something moving in the bushes. He slows down, heart pounding, and tries to see what it is. It's a lion! Wang's truck is between the lion and its prey, and the lion is not happy about it. Wang knows he needs to get out of there quickly, before the lion decides to attack. He reverses the truck and drives away as fast as he can. He's shaken, but he's safe. He's learned his lesson - he'll be more careful in the future.
