Tom looks down at the sleeping child and wonders how he ended up in this situation. He's never been good with kids, but he knows he has to do something. He can't just leave the child here alone. He looks around the hut and sees a few items that might be useful. He starts rummaging through the belongings and finds a blanket, a pillow, and some clothes. He sets these items down on the bed and tries to think of what to do next. He knows he can't take the child with him, but he also can't just leave him here. He decides to wait until morning and see if he can find help. He doesn't want to leave the child alone, so he sits down in a chair next to the bed and watches over him.
