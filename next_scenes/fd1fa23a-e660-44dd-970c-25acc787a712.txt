The creature drags Wang's unconscious body into the woods and begins to eat him. Wang is unaware of what is happening as he is being devoured by the creature. The creature tears Wang's body apart with its sharp claws and teeth. Wang's blood and guts are scattered all over the forest floor. The creature eats until it is full and then wanders off into the darkness, leaving Wang's mutilated body behind.
