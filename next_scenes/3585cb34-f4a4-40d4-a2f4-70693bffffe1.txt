Jenna sits at her desk, gazing out the window as the sky grows darker. She's finding it hard to focus on her homework with the pretty view distracting her. She keeps eyeing the trees and the way the leaves are rustling in the breeze. She gets an email notification and sees that it's from her friend Sarah. She's been working on this project together, but Sarah has been MIA all day. Jenna clicks to open the email and reads through Sarah's message. Sarah apologizes for not being able to help earlier and says she's been really busy. She's included a few links to websites that might be helpful. Jenna reads through the websites and starts to feel more confident about the project. She starts typing away and doesn't notice the time passing. Soon, it's dark outside and she's totally immersed in her work. She steps back from the desk to stretch her sore muscles. She feels good about the progress she's made and decides to call it a night. She closes the window and heads to bed, feeling calm and content.
