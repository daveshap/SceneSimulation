The children are getting tired, and Gabbi knows it's time to start winding down the game of tag. She starts to count to ten, and the children start to run back to the porch of the hut. Gabbi follows more slowly, her arms and legs aching from the heat and the exertion. Once they're all on the porch, Gabbi sits down in her chair and starts to fan herself again. The children are still full of energy, but they're starting to get drowsy. Gabbi sprays them with the water bottle one last time, and then starts to tell them a story. It's a story about a young girl who goes on an adventure, and it's one of Gabbi's favorites. The children listen quietly, their eyes drooping. And before long, they're all fast asleep. Gabbi smiles and gets up from her chair. She knows she'll have to wake them up soon, but for now, she's just happy to have a few moments of peace.
