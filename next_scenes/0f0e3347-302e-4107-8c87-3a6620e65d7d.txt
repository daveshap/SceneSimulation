The person outside Jenna's window was wearing a black ski mask and was holding a knife. Jenna was terrified and started to struggle. The intruder threatened to kill her if she made a noise. Jenna begged for her life and promised not to make a sound. The intruder then tied her up and gagged her. Jenna lay there shaking, not knowing what was going to happen to her.
