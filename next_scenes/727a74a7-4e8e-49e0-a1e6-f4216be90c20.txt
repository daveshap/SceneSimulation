The next day, Bob is at his coffee shop when he sees the man who was breaking into the apartment next door. He is walking down the street and Bob decides to confront him. He walks up to the man and says, "Hey, I saw you breaking into that apartment the other day. What were you doing?" The man looks around and sees that there is no one else around. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a knife. He holds it up to Bob's throat and says, "If you want to live, you'll give me all the money in the till." Bob's heart is racing. He doesn't know what to do. He reaches into the till and gives the man all the money. The man takes the money and runs away. Bob is shaken up but he is unharmed. He decides to call the police and report the incident.
