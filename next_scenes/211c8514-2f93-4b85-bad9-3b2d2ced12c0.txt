Aleksy is walking down the beach, admiring the sunset. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the waves are crashing against the shore. He takes a deep breath and feels the sand between his toes. Suddenly, he notices a figure in the distance. It's a woman, walking towards him. She's wearing a brightly colored dress and has a scarf around her head. As she gets closer, he can see that she's carrying a basket. She smiles at him and extends her hand. "Hello, my name is Dahlia. I'm a local fisherman's wife. I was just out for a walk and thought I'd come and say hello." Aleksy shakes her hand and introduces himself. Dahlia asks him if he's enjoying his stay in Asia, and the two of them chat for a while about the area and the local culture. Eventually, Dahlia has to head back home, but not before inviting Aleksy to come visit her and her husband sometime. Aleksy says he'd love to, and watch her walk away. He continues down the beach, admiring the peace and quiet. It's been a long day, and he's looking forward to getting back to his hotel and relaxing for the rest of the evening. But as he walks, he can't help but think about Dahlia and her friendly invitation. He's been travelling for a while now, and it's nice to meet someone who seems so genuine and down-to-earth. He decides to head back to her house and see if she's home. When he gets there, he sees her husband out in the yard, working on their boat. Dahlia sees him and comes out to greet him. Her husband, Lars, greets him warmly and invites him in for dinner. Aleksy accepts, and the three of them sit down to a meal of fresh fish and vegetables. They chat and laugh throughout the meal, and Aleksy feels right at home. After dinner, Dahlia and Lars show him around the town and introduce him to some of the other locals. He's only been in Asia for a few days, but already he feels like he's found a new home.
