Gabbi watches the sun set, lost in thought. She feels like she's at a crossroads in her life and isn't sure which path to take. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the waves are crashing against the shore. She's babysitting two children who are playing in the sand nearby. Suddenly, one of the children starts to cry. Gabbi snaps out of her reverie and goes over to comfort the child. She helps them up and brushed the sand off them. The other child comes over and Gabbi wraps her arms around them both. She reassures them that everything is okay and that they're safe. Gabbi sits with the children for a while, watching the sun set. She feels grateful for this moment, despite the confusion she's feeling about her life. She knows that she'll find the answers she's looking for, eventually. For now, she's just enjoying the peace and beauty of the beach.
