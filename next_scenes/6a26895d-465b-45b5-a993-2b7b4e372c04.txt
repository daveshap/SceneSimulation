Wang is sitting on the ground, leaning against the tree, trying to rest his injured leg. He is hungry and thirsty, and he has been trying to ration his food and water, but he is running out. He is starting to feel weak and dizzy. He knows he needs to find help soon. Suddenly, he hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is coming. Wang tries to call out, but his voice is weak and he is not sure if anyone can hear him. He tries to stand up, but his leg is too weak to support him. He falls back to the ground. The noise gets closer and Wang can see someone moving through the trees. It is a man, wearing tattered clothing and carrying a large pack. He looks like he has been walking for a long time. When he sees Wang, he comes over and introduces himself. He says his name is Roberto and he is on his way to a small village nearby. Wang tells Roberto his story and Roberto agrees to help him. He helps Wang to his feet and gives him some of his food and water. Wang is feeling a little better now, but he is still weak. Roberto says he will carry Wang on his back and they will make camp for the night. In the morning, they will continue on to the village and get Wang some help.
