Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he approached the group of men. He could see that they were holding a young woman captive, and he knew he had to do something to stop them. But he was so outnumbered and outmatched. He didn't know how he was going to get them to stop. He could see the fear in the woman's eyes, and he knew he had to act fast. He didn't want to get hurt, but he couldn't just leave her there. He had to do something. He took a deep breath and steeled himself for what he was about to do. He charged towards the group of men, yelling at the top of his lungs. He caught them off guard, and they started to back away from him. He grabbed the woman and pulled her away from them, and then he started to run. He could hear the men yelling and cursing after him, but he didn't stop. He ran as fast as he could until he finally lost them. He stopped to catch his breath, and he could see the fear in the woman's eyes. She was shaking, and she looked like she was about to faint. He put his arm around her to steady her, and then he started to lead her away from the alley. He didn't know what he was going to do, but he had to get her to safety.
