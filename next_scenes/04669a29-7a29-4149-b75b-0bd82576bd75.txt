Tom continued his stroll through the city, taking in the sights and sounds of Paris. He smiled as he watched children running and playing in the park. He noticed a young couple sitting on a bench, holding hands and gazing into each other's eyes. He sighed, thinking about his own search for love. He had been looking for years, but hadn't had any luck. Maybe one day he would find his special someone. For now, he was content working as a bartender and enjoying the simple things in life.
