Swathi sits on the sofa for a few minutes, letting the peacefulness of the cottage sink in. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, feeling her body relax. The sound of the birds outside the window is soothing, and the breeze through the trees makes a gentle rustling sound. After a few minutes, she gets up and wanders around the cottage, exploring each room. She smiles as she remembers all the good times she's had here. Finally, she make her way to her bedroom and get ready for bed. She climbs into bed and pulls the covers up to her chin, feeling safe and warm. As she drifts off to sleep, she can hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.
