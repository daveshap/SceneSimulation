Tom is jarred awake by the sound of breaking glass. He leaps to his feet and rushes into the kitchen, heart pounding, to find the back door smashed open and a large, furry creature standing in the middle of the room, eating from the fridge. Tom's mind races as he tries to figure out what to do. The creature is obviously very strong and could easily hurt him, but he can't just stand by and let it destroy his cottage. He takes a step forward, trying to look as big and intimidating as possible, and shouts at the creature in a deep, booming voice. "Hey! Get out of here! This is my home and you're not welcome!" The creature pauses for a moment, looking at Tom with its beady eyes, before turning back to the fridge and helping itself to another snack. Tom knows he can't just stand there and do nothing, so he charges forward, swinging his arms and trying to scare the creature off. But it's too late; the creature has had enough and turns on Tom, swiping at him with its powerful claws. Tom tries to dodge, but he's not fast enough and the creature's claws slice open his arm, causing him to cry out in pain. He staggers backwards, clutching his arm, as the creature calmly walks out the door and disappears into the woods. Tom sinks to the floor, heart racing, as he tries to process what just happened. His arm is throbbing and he knows he needs to get to a hospital, but first he has to call the police and report the break-in. He picks himself up and heads to the phone, trying to ignore the pain in his arm, and starts to dial 911.
