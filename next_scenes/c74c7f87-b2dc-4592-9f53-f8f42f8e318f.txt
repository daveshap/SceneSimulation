Swathi spent the next few hours walking around the tower, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. She was mesmerized by the beauty of the tower and the cityscape. As the night began to fall, she decided to head back to her hotel. She was tired from her travels but she was also exhilarated by the experience. She knew that she would never forget the time she spent at the Eifel Tower.
