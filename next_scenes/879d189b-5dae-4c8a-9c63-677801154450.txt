Mashawn wakes up some time later, groggy and disoriented. He tries to get up, but his head is spinning and he feels like he's going to vomit. He tries to remember what happened, but the last thing he remembers is hearing a noise in the bushes. He looks around and sees that he's in a clearing in the middle of the forest. His knife and wallet are gone, and he has a pounding headache. He staggers to his feet and starts to make his way back to the construction site. He's lucky to be alive, but he'll be lucky if he makes it out of the forest in one piece.
