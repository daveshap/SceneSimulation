The lioness sinks her teeth into Mashawn's flesh and he screams in pain. He knows he is going to die. As the lioness drags him away, he feels his life ebbing away. He sees his campsite in the distance and knows he will never make it back. His vision starts to fade and he feels himself slipping into unconsciousness. The last thing he hears is the lioness's triumphant roar.
