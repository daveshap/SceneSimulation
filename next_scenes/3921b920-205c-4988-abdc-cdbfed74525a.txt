Mashawn's heart is pounding in his chest as he cautiously enters the dark forest. He knows that he should not be here, but he cannot resist the lure of the forbidden place. As he walks deeper into the woods, Mashawn's anxiety grows with each step. The shadows seem to move menacingly around him, and he can hear strange noises coming from all around. Suddenly, he hears a twig snap behind him and he spins around, his heart pounding in his chest. There is nothing there but the pervasive darkness. Mashawn takes a deep breath and continues on, his senses on high alert. He knows that he is being watched, but he cannot see anything in the dense foliage. He feels something brushes his leg and he jumps, his heart in his throat. There is something here with him in the darkness, and he does not know what it is. He starts to run, but he can hear something pursuing him, crashing through the underbrush. He is getting tired, and he knows that he cannot keep running. He decides to hide and hope that whatever is following him will lose his trail. Mashawn scrambles up a tree and into the branches, his heart pounding in his ears. He waits, trembling, as whatever was following him draws nearer. He can see its eyes shining in the darkness, and then it moves past his hiding spot and continues on into the night. Mashawn waits until he is sure that it is gone before he climbs down from the tree. His heart is still racing, and he knows that he needs to get out of here. He starts to run back the way he came, and he does not stop until he is out of the forest.
