His boss is asking him a question, and Aleksy has no idea what the answer is. He stutters for a moment, trying to come up with something, but his mind is blank. His boss looks annoyed, and Aleksy knows he's in for a scolding. Aleksy's boss starts to yell at him, and Aleksy just sits there and takes it. He knows he deserves it, and he knows there's nothing he can say to defend himself. After a few minutes, his boss is done, and he storms out of the office. Aleksy is left alone, feeling embarrassed and ashamed. He knows he needs to do something to change his life, but he's not sure what.
