Wang is still waiting at the red light, and he is getting impatient. He looks at his watch and realizes that he is running late. He honks his horn, but the light doesn't change. He looks in his rearview mirror and sees a car coming up behind him. He hopes that the car will stop in time, but it doesn't. It rear-ends him, and he is pushed forward. His head hits the steering wheel, and he is knocked unconscious.
