Wang's eyes slowly open as the first light of day begins to filter into the room. He stretches and yawns, then climbs out of bed. He crosses to the window and looks out at the city, now awake and bustling with activity. He watches the people below for a moment, then turns back to the room. He begins to get dressed, buttoning his shirt and pulling on his pants. He puts on his shoes and heads for the door. He pauses for a moment, then looks back at the bed. He smiles to himself, then leaves the room.
