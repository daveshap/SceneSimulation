Mashawn is almost home from his walk, when he hears a loud commotion coming from the alleyway up ahead. He quickens his pace, but as he rounds the corner, he's met with the sight of a group of large men, attacking a smaller man. The man is trying to fight back, but he's outnumbered and outmatched. The men are laughing and jeering as they punch and kick the man. Mashawn knows he can't just stand by and watch, so he draws on all his courage and charges into the fray. He yelling and swinging his fists, trying to get the men to back off. It takes a few moments, but eventually the men leave, and Mashawn is left standing over the injured man. He helps the man to his feet and walks him to the nearest hospital.
