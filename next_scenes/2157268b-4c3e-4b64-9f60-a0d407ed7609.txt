Tom makes his way home, taking a shortcut through the alley. He's looking forward to getting home to his family and putting his feet up. As he turns the corner into the alley, he doesn't see the figure lurking in the shadows. The figure comes up behind Tom and puts a hand over his mouth, dragging him into the darkness. Tom tries to struggle, but the figure is too strong. He feels a sharp pain in his back and everything goes black.
