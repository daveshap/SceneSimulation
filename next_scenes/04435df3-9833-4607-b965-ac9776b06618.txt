Mashawn wakes up early the next morning, just as the sun is starting to peek over the horizon. He yawns and stretches, then gets out of bed and starts to get ready for the day. He puts on his work clothes - a pair of old, faded jeans and a t-shirt - and then grabs his bag of tools and heads out the door. The construction site is a couple of miles from Mashawn's house, so it takes him a while to walk there. When he finally arrives, he can see the other workers milling around, getting ready for the day's work. There's a large hole in the ground that will eventually be the foundation for a new building. Mashawn walks over to his work station and puts down his bag of tools. He pulls out a hammer and a nail, and begins working on the building's frame. The day goes by slowly, but eventually the sun starts to set and the work day comes to an end. Mashawn put away his tools and trudges back home, tired but satisfaction from a day's work well done. He eats a quick dinner, then falls into bed and falls asleep almost immediately.
