Mashawn finishes his lunch and puts his lunchbox away. He stretches and looks around at the construction site. He notices that some of the workers are taking a break as well. He sees one worker sitting on a piece of machinery, smoking a cigarette. Another worker is sitting on the ground, drinking from a water bottle. Mashawn decides to take a walk around the site. He looks at the different pieces of machinery and the progress that has been made on the construction project. He hears someone yell and he turns to see a worker falling from a ladder. He rushes over to help the worker.
