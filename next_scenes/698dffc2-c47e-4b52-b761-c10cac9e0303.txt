Mashawn is walking quickly down the hall, looking for anyone who can help. He turns a corner and sees a janitor pushing a broom. He runs up to the janitor and starts telling him what happened. The janitor doesn't seem to understand at first, but then he realizes what Mashawn is saying. He drops his broom and runs to get help. Mashawn goes back to the body. He doesn't know what to do, so he just stands there. He looks around, but there is still no one around. He feels like he should do something, but he doesn't know what. After a few minutes, he hears footsteps coming down the hall. He turns around and sees a group of people running towards him. They are the janitor and some other workers from the building. They ask Mashawn what happened. He tells them about the man falling from the upper floors. They all look horrified. One of the workers runs to get the building superintendent. The others start to crowd around the body. They all seem to be in shock. No one knows what to do.
