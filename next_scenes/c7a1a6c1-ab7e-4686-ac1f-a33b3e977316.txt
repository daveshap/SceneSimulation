Sandy's screams echo through the forest as the jaguar drags her away. Her baby is left crying alone on the ground, its little arms outstretched towards its mother. The sun has almost set now, and the shadows are getting longer and longer. Suddenly, there is a rustling in the bushes and the baby starts to cry even louder. A large snake slithers out of the undergrowth and starts to make its way towards the baby. The baby sees the snake and tries to scoot away, but it is too weak and tired to move. The snake gets closer and closer, its cold body slithering across the ground. It opens its mouth, ready to strike, when there is a loud noise from the bushes. A large bird swoops down and grabs the snake in its talons, carrying it away into the night. The baby is now alone in the dark forest, its mother nowhere to be found.
