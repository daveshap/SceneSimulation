Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he stared at the figure in front of him. He couldn't see much in the darkness, but he could make out a large, muscular frame and a deep, guttural voice. The figure spoke in a foreign language that Aleksy didn't understand, but the tone was clear - he was in trouble. The figure grabbed Aleksy by the arm and began leading him through the forest, moving quickly and deftly through the trees. Aleksy tried to struggle, but the grip on his arm was like iron. He had no choice but to go along with the figure, wherever he was being taken. After what felt like hours of walking, they came to a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a small, nondescript hut. The figure pushed Aleksy inside and motioned for him to sit down. Aleksy looked around the hut, taking in his surroundings. It was dark and musty inside, with only a small window in the back wall letting in any light. There was a table in the center of the room and a few rickety chairs, but otherwise the hut was empty. The figure sat down in one of the chairs and stared at Aleksy for a long moment, as if considering something. Finally, he spoke again, this time in broken English. "You are lost," he said. "I can help you find your way out of the forest, but you must do something for me first." Aleksy frowned, not sure what to expect. "What do you want me to do?" he asked. "I want you to kill the dragon," the figure replied. Aleksy's eyes widened in disbelief. "The dragon? But that's impossible!" he protested. The figure leaned forward, his gaze intense. "If you want to leave this place, you will kill the dragon," he said. "Do you understand?" Aleksy nodded, his throat dry. He didn't know how he was going to kill a dragon, but he knew he had to try. The figure handed him a sword and a shield, then pointed to the door. "The dragon is waiting for you," he said. "Good luck." Aleksy took a deep breath and stepped out of the hut. He had never felt so terrified in his life, but he knew he had to go through with it. He tightened his grip on the sword and shield and started towards the dragon.
