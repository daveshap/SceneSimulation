Sandy enters her son's room and finds him sitting in his crib, crying hysterically. She picks him up and tries to comfort him, but he continues to cry. She rocks him back and forth, and he slowly begins to calm down. She sits in the rocking chair with him and sings a lullaby. After a few minutes, he is fast asleep. Sandy gently lays him down in his crib and tiptoes out of the room.
