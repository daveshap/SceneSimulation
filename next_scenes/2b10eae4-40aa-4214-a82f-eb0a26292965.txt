Swathi is running as fast as she can, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear the creature behind her, its heavy footsteps pounding the ground. She trips on a rock and falls, barely having time to brace herself before the creature is upon her. She closes her eyes, preparing for the worst, but then hears someone yelling. She opens her eyes to see a man running towards the creature, waving a large stick. He hits the creature over the head with the stick and it runs away. The man helps Swathi to her feet and asks if she's okay. Swathi nods, still in shock. She thanks the man for saving her and then runs back down the mountain, vowing never to return.
