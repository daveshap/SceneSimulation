Gabbi is huddled in the tree trunk with the children, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows the werewolf is out there somewhere, and she knows it's only a matter of time before it comes back. She has to find a way to kill it before that happens. She looks around the tree trunk for something she can use as a weapon, but all she can find are some sticks and leaves. She knows they won't be enough to kill the werewolf, but she has to try. She quietly whispers to the children to stay quiet and still, and then she climbs out of the tree trunk. She crouches down behind a bush, and waits for the werewolf to appear. She knows she only has one chance at this, and she has to make it count. She sees the werewolf lurking in the shadows, and she takes a deep breath. She launches herself out of the bushes and tackles the werewolf to the ground. She plunges her makeshift weapon into the werewolf's heart, and it cries out in pain. It thrashes around for a few moments, and then it's still. Gabbi knows she's done, and she can finally relax. The children are safe, and the werewolf is dead.
