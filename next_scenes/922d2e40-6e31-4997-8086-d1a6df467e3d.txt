Wang pulled up to the final address of the day, a large office building downtown. He checked the address against the package he had been delivered, then got out and headed inside. He took the elevator up to the specified floor and found the right office. He knocked on the door and waited for a moment before a frazzled-looking woman answered. She thanked him hurriedly as she took the package from him, then slammed the door shut. Wang shrugged and headed back to the elevator. He was grateful that his day was finally over. It had been a long one, and he was ready to head home to his family. He knew his wife and kids would be excited to hear about his day, and he couldn't wait to tell them all about it. He climbed into his van and started the long drive home, feeling happy and accomplished.
