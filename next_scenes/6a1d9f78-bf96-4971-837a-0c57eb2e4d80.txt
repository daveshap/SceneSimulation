The sun continues to beat down relentlessly on the concertgoers, who are now drenched in sweat. Sandy's flowy dress is sticking to her skin and her hair is starting to fall out of her bun. She doesn't seem to notice the discomfort though, as she's still lost in the music, dancing and singing along with the rest of the crowd. The crowd starts to thin out as the sun sets and the temperature drops. Sandy is one of the last people to leave, her dress now muddy and her hair a tangled mess. She's still smiling though, as she's clearly had the time of her life.
