The concert comes to an end, and Sandy is sad to see it go. She's been having the time of her life, and she doesn't want it to end. But she knows that she'll be back again soon. The crowd starts to disperse, and Sandy makes her way towards the exit. She's still buzzing from the music, and she can't wait to see the band again. As she exits the venue, she runs into one of her friends. They chat for a moment about the concert, and then they go their separate ways. Sandy heads home, and she can't wait to tell her family and friends all about the amazing time she had.
