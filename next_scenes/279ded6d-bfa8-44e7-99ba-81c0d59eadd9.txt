Wang arrives at the hospital with the injured woman. He rushes her inside and up to the front desk. The receptionist takes one look at the woman and starts to buzz for a doctor. Wang sets the woman down in a chair and steps back. He can see that she is still breathing, but she is not conscious. He knows that she needs medical help quickly. A doctor comes rushing out from the back. She takes one look at the woman and starts barking orders. She asks Wang what happened. Wang quickly tells her everything. The doctor nods and starts to examine the woman. She orders a few nurses to come and help her. They quickly wheel the woman back to the operating room. Wang is left alone in the waiting room. He sinks down into a chair and puts his head in his hands. He knows that the woman is going to need surgery, and he hopes that she will be okay. He waits for what seems like hours. Finally, the doctor comes back out. She tells Wang that the woman is going to be okay. She has a few broken bones and a concussion, but she will recover. Wang is relieved. The doctor thanks him for bringing the woman in and tells him that he is a hero.
