Sandy continues to look around her room, her eyes landing on the clothes hamper in the corner. She walks over to it and starts to rummage through it, looking for something to wear. She pulls out a pair of jeans and a shirt and quickly gets dressed. She doesn't bother with her hair or makeup, she just wants to get out of the house. She walks to the door and opens it, stepping into the hallway. She can hear the sounds of her neighbor's children playing outside and it makes her heart ache. She starts to walk down the hallway, her mind racing with all of the things she wishes she had. She wishes she had a family of her own to take vacations with, she wishes she had a partner to come home to at the end of the day. As she walks, she notices pictures of her and her friends on the wall. She stops to look at them, a sad smile on her face. She remembers all of the good times they had together, but it only makes her feel worse. She eventually snaps out of it and continues down the hallway until she reaches the front door. She opens the door and steps outside, immediately being greeted by the sound of her neighbor's children playing. She can't take it anymore. She quickly turns and goes back inside, her heart heavy with sadness.
