The phone continues to ring, and Swathi debates whether to answer it or not. She's so close to finishing this project, and she doesn't want to be interrupted. But the phone keeps ringing, and she eventually decides to answer it. "Hello?" she says, trying to sound as professional as possible. "Hey, Swathi, it's Raj," her boss says on the other end. "I need you to come into the office, we've got a problem." "Okay, I'll be right there," she says, hanging up the phone. She sighed, knowing that this project would have to wait. She quickly straightened up the bedroom, thrown on some clothes, and left for the office.
