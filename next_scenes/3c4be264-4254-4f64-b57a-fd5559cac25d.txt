Aleksy's roommates continue to give him a hard time about sleeping in, but he doesn't mind. He's used to their good-natured teasing. He finishes his piece of toast and washes it down with a cup of coffee. He knows he'll be wide awake soon enough. He gets up from the table and puts his cup in the sink. He grabs his keys and wallet from the counter and heads for the door. As he steps out into the hallway, he can hear his roommates moving around in the kitchen. He knows they'll give him a hard time about sleeping in, but he can't help it. He's just not a morning person. Aleksy makes his way down the hallway and out the front door. He gets in his car and starts the engine. He backs out of the driveway and heads for the highway. He has a long drive ahead of him, but he knows he'll make it there eventually.
