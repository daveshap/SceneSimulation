She can hear the screams of panicking people all around her, but she feels like she's in a daze. She can't believe this is happening. eventually, someone comes and leads her away from the scene. She can't take her eyes off the tower, and the image of it collapsing will stay with her forever. As she's led away, Jenna sees the other students from her group. They look just as shocked and horrified as she feels. Jenna can't imagine what they're going through. This trip was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but now it's been tainted by this tragedy. Jenna is quiet on the way back to the hotel. She can't get the image of the tower collapsing out of her mind. She knows this will be a trip she'll never forget, but not for the reasons she had originally hoped.
