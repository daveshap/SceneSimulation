Mashawn continues to work on the construction project, feeling the heat of the sun beating down on him through his space suit. He is growing tired, but knows that he needs to finish the job before he can take a break. He starts to wonder how much longer he will have to work on the project and if his fellow workers are also feeling as tired as he is. Suddenly, he hears a voice over his radio. It is his supervisor, telling him that the project is finished and he can take a break. Mashawn is relieved and happy to hear the news. He radioes back to his supervisor, thanking them for the update. He then starts to gather his tools and prepares to head back to the space station.
