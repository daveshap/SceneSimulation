The young woman walked away from Mashawn, her heart pounding in her chest. She had been planning to approach him for the past week and she was so nervous that she had almost chickened out. But she had mustered up the courage and she was glad that she did. He was even more handsome in person than he was in the pictures she had seen of him online. She couldn't believe her luck when he agreed to let her take his picture. She walked quickly back to her hotel, her mind racing the entire way. She could barely contain her excitement as she rushed to edit the pictures she had just taken. She uploaded them to her website with a quick caption and then sat back to wait. It didn't take long for the page to blow up. She had only been running the website for a few months, but it was already starting to get a lot of attention. She was quickly becoming one of the most popular bloggers in Asia. And it was all thanks to Mashawn.
