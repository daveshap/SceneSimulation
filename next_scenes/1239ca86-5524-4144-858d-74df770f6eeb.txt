The moon is high in the sky, casting a soft light over the sleeping children. Gabbi is sitting in a chair next to their beds, watching them as they sleep. She smiles as she hears their soft breathing and the occasional snore from one of them. She knows that they are safe and sound in their beds and she can't help but feel grateful for that. As she sits there, she hears a noise coming from outside. She gets up to investigate and sees that the noise is coming from the garden. She quietly makes her way outside, trying not to make a sound. As she approaches the garden, she sees a figure moving around in the darkness. She can't see who it is, but she knows that they are up to no good. She quietly creeps up behind the figure and taps them on the shoulder. As they turn around, she gasps. She can't believe that it is the man who has been stalking her for the past few weeks.
