Wang enters the bedroom, placing a delivery on the bed. He looks around the room, taking in the various pieces of furniture and decorations. He notices a photo of the customer on the bedside table and pauses for a moment, looking at it. He then continues his delivery, placing the rest of the items in the room. He finishes his delivery and prepares to leave, but pauses when he sees the customer's laptop on the bed. He looks around the room again, and then decides to take the laptop with him. Wang makes his way to the door, but pauses when he hears voices in the hallway. He quickly grabs the laptop and hides under the bed, just as the customer and another person enter the room. Wang listens as the two people talk, his heart racing as he tries to remain silent. After a few minutes, the two people leave the room and Wang waits a few moments before emerging from his hiding spot. He quickly grabs the laptop and leaves the room, making his way back to the customer's apartment.
