Aleksy finishes his lunch break and heads back inside to the grocery store. He is greeted by several customers who are eager to get their shopping done. He helps them find what they need and bag their groceries. The morning rushes by in a blur and before he knows it, it is time for his lunch break. He sits down outside in the sun to eat his sandwich and drink his water. He people-watches as he eats, wondering what their stories are. He feels grateful for his job and for the simple things in life.
