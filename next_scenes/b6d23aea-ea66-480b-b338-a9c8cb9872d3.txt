Wang drives his delivery truck down the mountain, his heart pounding in his chest. He can't shake the feeling that something is watching him, but he doesn't dare look back. He concentrates on the road ahead, willing the truck to move faster. He doesn't relax until he reaches the bottom of the mountain and is back on level ground. He breathed a sigh of relief and wiped the sweat from his brow. It was then that he realized he had left the castle gates open. He cursed himself for being so careless and turned the truck around. He glanced up at the castle as he drove through the gates, half expecting to see something staring down at him, but he saw nothing. He shook off the feeling of unease and drove back down the mountain, never once looking back.
