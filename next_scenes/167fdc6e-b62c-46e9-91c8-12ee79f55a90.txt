Wang silently celebrates his victory as he makes his way to the restaurant. He had been walking around for what felt like hours, and he was starting to get really tired. But now he has finally found the place, and he can deliver the package. Wang walks up to the front door of the restaurant and knocks. He can hear voices inside, but no one comes to the door. He waits for a few moments, but still no one comes. Wang starts to get impatient, and he decides to go around back to see if he can find a way in. As Wang walks around the back of the restaurant, he hears a noise. It sounds like someone is crying. He follows the noise until he comes to a window. He looks inside and sees a woman crying at a table. Wang is about to turn away when he sees the woman get up and walk to the window. She looks right at him, and their eyes meet.
