Tom sits on his porch, sipping his wine and taking in the peaceful evening around him. The leaves are gently falling from the trees, and the air is filled with the scent of wood smoke. Tom feels relaxed and content, and he knows that he'll be able to get a good night's sleep tonight. Suddenly, Tom hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. Tom gets up from his porch and starts walking towards the noise. He follows the noise until he comes to a clearing in the woods. In the clearing, Tom sees a young woman sitting on the ground, her face in her hands. She looks up as Tom approaches, and he can see that she's been crying. Tom asks the woman what's wrong, and she tells him that she's lost. She's been walking in the woods for hours, and she can't find her way back to her campsite. Tom tells the woman not to worry, and he offers to help her find her way back. He takes her hand and leads her out of the woods. When they get back to her campsite, Tom says goodbye to the woman and wishing her a good night's sleep.
