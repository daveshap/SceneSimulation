Wang continues to watch the woman as she walks across the parking lot. She seems to be in a hurry and is looking around as if she is lost. Wang finishes his sandwich and soda and decides to follow her. He gets out of his car and walks a few steps behind her. She turns into the office building and he follows her. She goes into the restroom and he waits outside the door. He hears her inside the stall crying. He wonders what he should do.
