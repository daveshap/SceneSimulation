The lunch rush dies down and Bob is able to take a break. He sits down at one of the tables and enjoys a cup of coffee and a sandwich. As he eats, he looks around the shop and smiles. He's proud of what he's built here. It may not be much, but it's a special place for a lot of people. Bob is interrupted from his thoughts by the sound of the door opening. He looks up to see a young woman walking in. She looks around nervously, as if she's not sure if she's in the right place. Bob gets up and goes to greet her. "Can I help you?" he asks. "Um, yes," she says. "I'm looking for a job. I saw your sign in the window." Bob smiles and leads her over to the counter. He takes out an application and hands it to her. "Fill this out and I'll be with you in a minute," he says. The woman takes the application and sits down at a table. Bob goes back to his own table and finishes his lunch. He's looking forward to meeting this woman and seeing if she's a good fit for the coffee shop.
