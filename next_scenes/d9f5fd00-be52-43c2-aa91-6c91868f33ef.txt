Tom finishes serving a round of drinks to his customers and moves down the bar to chat with a few of them. He jokes and laughs with them, and they seem to be having a good time. Suddenly, there is a loud explosion. Tom looks up in shock as the Eiffel Tower is engulfed in flames. The bar erupts into chaos as people scream and run for the exits. Tom tries to keep calm as he starts herding people toward the exit. The fire is spreading quickly, and Tom knows he needs to get out of there fast. He makes his way to the exit, but the smoke and heat are becoming overwhelming. He starts to feel lightheaded and dizzy. Just as he reaches the door, Tom collapses to the ground. He is unconscious and unaware of the chaos that is unfolding around him.
