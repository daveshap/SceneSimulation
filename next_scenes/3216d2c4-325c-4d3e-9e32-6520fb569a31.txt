The sun slowly rises higher in the sky, casting a warm glow on the group. The children play in the sand, building castles and digging moats. Gabbi watches them with a smile, happy to be spending the morning with them. The waves continue to crash against the shore, and the smell of salt water fills the air. After a while, the children start to get restless. They beg Gabbi to take them for a swim. She agrees, and they all run down to the water. The cold water is a shock at first, but they soon adjust and start splashing around. They laugh and play in the waves, having a great time. After a while, they start to get hungry. Gabbi leads them back to the beach, where they sit down and eat the snacks she brought. They chat and laugh as they eat, enjoying the beautiful day.
