Sandy is still sitting on the bench, enjoying the view of the Eiffel Tower. She's almost finished with her sandwich, and she's feeling more relaxed than she has in months. The sun is shining, and there's a gentle breeze blowing. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, feeling grateful for this moment of peace. Suddenly, she hears a loud noise and opens her eyes to see a group of people running towards her. They're all shouting and looking panicked, and Sandy has no idea what's going on. She stands up and tries to run in the opposite direction, but there's so many people that she can't move. She's surrounded by panicked people, and she has no idea what's going on.
