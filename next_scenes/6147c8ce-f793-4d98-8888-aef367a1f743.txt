The door closes behind Bob and his wife, shutting out the peaceful night. Bob flops down onto the couch and lets out a long sigh. "It's good to be home," he says, picking up the remote. His wife smiles and starts unpacking her suitcase. "I'm going to take a shower," she says, heading towards the bathroom. "Okay, honey," Bob replies, flipping through the channels. After a few minutes, he hears the sound of the shower running. He gets up and walks to the bathroom door, peeking inside. His wife is standing in the shower, her head tilted back and her eyes closed, enjoying the feel of the hot water. "I'm going to bed," Bob says, turning away. "Okay, goodnight," his wife replies, still lost in the moment. Bob goes to his bedroom and gets into bed, and after a few minutes, he hears his wife come into the room and get into bed next to him. They snuggle close and fall asleep, happy to be home.
