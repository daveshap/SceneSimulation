The man inside the office is still on the phone and seems to be getting more and more agitated. He is pacing back and forth and Sandy can see that he is getting red in the face. She is not sure what to do and is debating whether or not she should just walk away. Suddenly, the man slams the phone down on the desk and starts yelling. Sandy can hear him even though she is not sure what he is saying. She is about to walk away when the man notices her and starts walking towards the door. Sandy is frozen in place and is not sure what to do. The man walks up to her and starts to say something, but Sandy can't hear him. She just stands there with a blank look on her face.
