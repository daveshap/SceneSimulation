Swathi walks into the kitchen and goes to the fridge. She takes out a carton of eggs and sets them on the counter. She then gets a pan from the cupboard and sets it on the stove. She turns on the stove and cracks two eggs into the pan. She uses a fork to scramble them and then puts some salt and pepper on them. She lets them cook for a few minutes and then uses a spatula to put them on a plate. She grabs a piece of bread from the bread box and puts it in the toaster. She pushes down the lever and then waits a few minutes. The bread pops up and she butter it and then puts it on the plate with the eggs. She grabs a fork and Knife and begins to eat.
