Aleksy is standing in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He looks up at the stage, where the band is playing, and feels a sense of joy and excitement. He looks around at the people around him, and feels a sense of connection to them. He feels alive and happy in this moment. He closes his eyes and lets the music wash over him, feeling the beat in his chest and the joy in his heart.
