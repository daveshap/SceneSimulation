The bar gets back to business as usual after the commotion. Tom goes back to mixing drinks and chatting with customers. The group of young men is long gone, and the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed now. The woman who was harassed by the drunk man is still sitting at her table, nursing a drink. She catches Tom's eye and gives him a small smile of thanks. Tom nods back at her, then goes back to work. Suddenly, the doors to the bar burst open again and the group of police officers come back in. They walk up to Tom and tell him that they've been getting complaints about the bar being a disturbance. Tom is confused and asks what they're talking about. The police officers tell him that there have been multiple reports of fights and rowdy behavior coming from the bar. They say that they're going to have to shut the place down unless Tom can get the situation under control. Tom is horrified and tells the officers that he'll do whatever it takes to keep the bar open. They tell him that they'll be back in a few days to check on the situation. If things haven't improved, the bar will be shut down for good. Tom nods and the officers leave. He stands there for a moment, feeling overwhelmed. Then he takes a deep breath and goes back to work, determined to keep his business afloat.
