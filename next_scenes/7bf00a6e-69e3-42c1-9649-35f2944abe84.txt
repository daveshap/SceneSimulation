Mashawn is driving away from his cottage as fast as he can. His heart is pounding in his chest, and he can't believe what he just saw. He's never believe in ghosts before, but he knows that what he saw was real. He's not sure what to do or where to go, but he knows he needs to get away from the cottage. He drives for hours, and he doesn't stop until he's in a different town. He checks into a hotel and tries to get some sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the ghosts. He's not sure what he's going to do, but he knows he needs to find a way to get rid of them.
