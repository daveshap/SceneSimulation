Tom finished up his shift as the last rays of sunlight disappeared behind the Eiffel Tower. He wiped down the bar and said goodbye to the customers, most of whom were still staring up at the beautiful structure. As he walked out from under the Tower, he saw the young couple he'd been watching earlier. They were still holding hands and whispering to each other, and they looked as happy as ever. Tom smiled to himself and walked away, thinking about how lucky he was to have a job that let him share in the joy of others.
