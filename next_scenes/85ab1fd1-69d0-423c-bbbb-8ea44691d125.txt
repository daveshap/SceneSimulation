Tom felt a sharp pain in his head as he hit the ground. He tried to get up, but he was disoriented and couldn't see where he was. He felt someone's hands on him, and then he was being dragged away. He couldn't tell who it was, but he knew he was in trouble. He tried to struggle, but he was weak from the fall. He was pulled into a dark room and thrown onto a cold, hard floor. He tried to get up again, but he was dizzy and couldn't see straight. He heard the door slam shut and he was alone in the darkness. Tom tried to calm himself down, but he was terrified. He had no idea what was going to happen to him.
