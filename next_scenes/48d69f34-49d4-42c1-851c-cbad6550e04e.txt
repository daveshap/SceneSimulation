The first band's set is in full swing, and the crowd is loving it. Wang is still near the front of the stage, and he's totally caught up in the music. He's bobbing his head along to the beat and tapping his feet, and he's even singing along to some of the songs. He's totally lost in the moment, and he's having the time of his life. The next thing he knows, the set is over and the crowd is cheering. He's not ready for it to end, but he knows that the headlining act is about to take the stage. He's on the edge of his seat in excitement, and he's ready to rock out.
