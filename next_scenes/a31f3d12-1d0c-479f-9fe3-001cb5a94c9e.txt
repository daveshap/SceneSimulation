Sandy finishes her breakfast and clears the table. She takes her coffee mug and heads to the living room. She sits down on the couch and turns on the TV. She flips through the channels, looking for something to watch. After a few minutes, she finds a news show and starts to watch. The reporter is talking about a new virus that is spreading through the city. Sandy starts to feel a little worried. She gets up and turns off the TV. She doesn't want to think about the virus right now. She goes to the kitchen and starts cleaning up. She washes the dishes and cleans the counters. Then she goes to the bedroom to make the bed. Once she's done, she goes back to the living room and sits down on the couch. She picks up her book and starts to read. After a while, she starts to feel tired. She gets up and goes to the bedroom. She changes into her pajamas and gets into bed. She turns off the light and falls asleep.
