Mashawn wakes up early the next morning, his body aching from the previous day's work. He slowly gets out of bed, wincing as his muscles protest. He knows he needs to get moving if he's going to make it to the construction site on time. He takes a quick shower, then throws on some clothes and heads out the door. The streets are already busy with people rushing to work. Mashawn weaves his way through the crowd, his mind focused on the day ahead. He knows he'll be working long hours again today, but he doesn't mind. He's just happy to have a job. He arrives at the construction site and punches in for his shift. He grabs a hard hat and a toolbelt, then heads out to the worksite. He spends the next few hours working on the foundation of the new building. The work is hard, but he's used to it by now. By lunchtime, Mashawn is starving. He takes a quick break to eat the sandwich his wife packed for him. He sits in the shade, enjoying the brief respite from the heat. He knows he'll have to get back to work soon, but for now, he just savors the peace and quiet. Eventually, Mashawn heads back to the worksite. He works until dusk, when his shift finally ends. He punches out, then trudges back to his apartment, exhausted from another long day.
