The sun slowly rises over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the world. Tom watches in awe as the colors change and the world comes to life. He feels a sense of peace wash over him as he takes in the beauty of nature. As the sun continues to rise, Tom feels his own body come to life. He stretches his arms and legs, taking in a deep breath of fresh air. He can't help but smile as he feels the sand between his toes and the sun on his skin. For a few minutes, he forgets about everything else in the world and he just exists in this moment. And in that moment, he feels complete.
