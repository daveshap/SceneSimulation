Wang sprints back to the base, his heart pounding in his chest. He knows he needs to find help for the woman, but he's not sure where to go. He arrives at the main entrance to the base and is relieved to see two security guards standing outside. He rushes up to them, panting and sweating. "Help me," he says, "there's a woman in trouble. She's covered in some kind of pink goo and she's unconscious." The security guards exchange a look before one of them says, "Okay, we'll go check it out. You stay here." Wang watches as the security guards head off towards the woman's dome. He stands there for a few minutes, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, he hears a scream coming from the direction of the dome. Wang takes off running towards the sound. As he gets closer, he can see that the pink goo is now covering the entrance to the dome. There's no way the security guards are going to be able to get inside. Wang knows he has to do something. He takes a deep breath and charges towards the goo, plunging headfirst into it. He feels himself being pulled inside the dome and the next thing he knows, he's standing in the middle of a pink mist. He can hear the woman screaming for help, but she's nowhere to be seen. Wang starts to feel lightheaded and dizzy. He knows he needs to find the woman and get out of there before the goo destroys him too. He starts to walk forward, but it's difficult to see through the mist. Suddenly, he feels something slimy wrap around his leg, tripping him. He falls to the ground and feels the goo start to cover his body. He screams for help as he feels himself being pulled into the pink mist.
