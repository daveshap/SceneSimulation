Wang finishes his delivery and begins the long drive back down the mountain. The road is even more treacherous in the darkness, and Wang has to concentrate hard to keep the truck from careening off the edge. He passes a few other vehicles along the way, but for the most part the road is empty. As he nears the bottom of the mountain, he sees a large truck coming up the road towards him. The truck is going too fast for the conditions and it fishtails as it rounds a corner. Wang tries to swerve out of the way, but the truck slams into his side, sending his truck careening off the road. Wang's truck tumbles down the mountainside, flipping end over end. He is thrown from the truck and crashes through a tree, knocking himself unconscious. When he comes to, he is in a hospital bed, surrounded by concerned family and friends.
