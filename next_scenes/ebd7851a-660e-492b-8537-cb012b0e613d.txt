Gabbi waves goodbye to Luke and Mia, her heart heavy with envy. She's happy to see her friend so happy, but she can't help feeling a little left behind. It feels like everyone is moving on with their lives while she's stuck in the same old routine. Gabbi walks home slowly, her mind racing. She's been feeling like this a lot lately. like she's stuck in a rut. She's been thinking about making some changes, but she's not sure where to start. When she gets home, she finds her husband, Mark, watching TV. She joins him on the couch and snuggles up against him. "How was your day, babe?" he asks. Gabbi sighs. "It was fine. I went to the park to meet Mia. I ended up meeting her new boyfriend, Luke." "That's great," Mark says. "I'm happy for her." Gabbi nods. "I am too. I just can't help feeling a little left behind. Everyone seems to be moving on with their lives while I'm stuck in the same old routine." Mark wraps his arm around her. "I know how you feel. I feel like that sometimes too. But we can't let ourselves get stuck in a rut. We have to make our own happiness." Gabbi nods. "You're right. I think I'm going to take your advice and make some changes." Mark smiles. "I think that's a great idea. I'm here to support you, no matter what you decide to do." Gabbi leans over and kisses him. "Thank you. I'm going to go take a long bath and think about what I want to do." Mark nods. "Sounds like a plan. I'll make us some dinner." Gabbi smiles and heads to the bathroom. She's excited to make some changes in her life and she knows Mark will support her every step of the way.
