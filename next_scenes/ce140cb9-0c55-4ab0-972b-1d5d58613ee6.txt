Sandy is still sitting on the beach, enjoying the peacefulness of the moment. She's been snacking on some of the food she brought with her and sipping on a cold drink. The sun is starting to get a bit hotter, so she's moved her chair into the shade of a nearby umbrella. She's still got her book with her, but she's not really in the mood to read it. She's content to just sit there and enjoy the sound of the waves and the feel of the sand between her toes. Every now and then, she looks up at the people walking by, but for the most part, she's content to just sit there and enjoy the moment.
