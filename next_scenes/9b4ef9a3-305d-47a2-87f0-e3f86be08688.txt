Tom is busy serving customers in the bar when he notices a tall, well-dressed man walking in. The man has a dark suit and a black briefcase in his hand. He looks around the bar and then walks up to the counter. Tom: Hi, what can I get you? Man: I'll have a bourbon, neat. Tom pours the drink and hands it to the man. The man takes a sip and then looks around the bar again. Man: This is a busy place. Tom: Yeah, we've been busy all night. The man takes another sip of his drink and then looks at Tom. Man: You seem to be doing a good job. Tom: Thanks. I love my job. The man nods and then looks around the bar again. After a few minutes, he finishes his drink and then sets some money on the counter. Man: I'm going to go take a look around. Tom: Okay, let me know if you need anything. The man nods and then walks away. Tom watches him as he goes and then goes back to serving customers.
