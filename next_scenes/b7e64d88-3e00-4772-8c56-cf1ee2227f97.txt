Jenna walks for a few more blocks, her mind on the group of kids she saw playing video games. She wonders what it would be like to have friends to hang out with after school. Jenna is so lost in thought that she doesn't notice the group of boys walking behind her until it's too late. She feels a hard push from behind and stumbles, her backpack flying off her shoulder. Jenna falls to the ground, skinning her knees. She looks up to see the group of boys laughing and running away. Jenna feels her eyes fill with tears as she tries to stand up. Her backpack is lying in a puddle a few feet away, and her knees are throbbing. Jenna starts to limp towards her backpack when she hears someone calling her name. Jenna turns to see her neighbor, Mrs. Garcia, coming towards her.
