Bob leads the child out of the office building and into the coffee shop. He seats them at a table and goes to the back to get them a sandwich and a drink. As he's fixing the sandwich, he can't help but wonder how the child ended up in the office building all alone. He decides he'll ask them when he brings the food out. He puts the sandwich and drink on a tray and takes it to the child's table. "Here you go," he says, setting the tray down. "I'm Bob, by the way. What's your name?" The child takes a bite of the sandwich and looks up at Bob. "My name is Timmy," he says. "I'm sorry for stealing your chips. I was just really hungry." "It's okay, Timmy," Bob says. "I'm just glad I was here to help. Now, why don't you tell me what you're doing here all alone? Do you have a family nearby?" Timmy shakes his head. "My mom died a few months ago, and my dad can't take care of me. He's always working, and I'm all alone at home. I got scared one day and ran away. I've been living on the streets ever since." Bob's heart sinks as he listens to Timmy's story. He can't imagine what it would be like to be a child, all alone and scared, trying to survive on the streets. "Well, Timmy, you don't have to worry anymore," Bob says. "You can stay here with me. I'll take care of you." Timmy's eyes light up, and he smiles. "Thank you, Bob," he says. "I'm so happy I found you."
