The concert continues for a few more hours and Mashawn is starting to get tired. He's not sure if he wants to stay for the whole thing, but he's enjoying himself so far. The sun is starting to set and the atmosphere is still festive. The crowd is starting to thin out as people leave to go home or to other events. Mashawn is still tapping his foot along to the beat and clapping his hands when the chorus comes in. He's starting to feel a bit hungry, but he doesn't want to leave just yet. He's considering getting something to eat from one of the food vendors, but he's not sure if he wants to spend the money. He's debating whether or not to stay for the end of the concert or to go get something to eat.
