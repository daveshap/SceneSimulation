The girl watches Wang as he walks away, still smiling. She's curious about him and decides to follow him. Wang doesn't notice her as he walks back to his truck and puts the pizza box in the back. He's about to get in when the girl speaks up. "That was a pretty rough fall you took back there," she says. Wang turns and looks at her. He's surprised that she noticed. "Yeah, I guess it was," he says. "You're lucky that pizza box didn't break," she says. "If it had, you would have been covered in cheese and tomato sauce." Wang laughs. "Yeah, that would have been a mess," he says. The girl smiles. "I'm sorry about that guy bumping into you," she says. "Some people just don't know how to have fun." "It's all right," Wang says. "I'm just glad the pizza is okay." "So are you delivering pizzas tonight?" the girl asks. "Yeah, I am," Wang says. "I just finished my shift, actually." "That's cool," the girl says. "I'm sure a lot of people are happy to get their pizzas on time." "I hope so," Wang says. "I'm just doing my job, you know?" "Well, I think you're doing a great job," the girl says. Wang blushes. "Thanks," he says. "I appreciate that." The girl smiles. "I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name," she says. "It's Wang," he says. "What about you?" "I'm Lily," she says. "Nice to meet you, Lily," Wang says. "You too, Wang," she says. They stand there for a moment, smiling at each other. Then Lily looks at her watch. "I should probably get going," she says. "It was nice meeting you." "Yeah, you too," Wang says. Lily turns and starts to walk away. Wang watches her for a moment, then gets in his truck and drives off.
