Wang climbs back into his truck and starts to drive. He can't believe what just happened. He's never seen anything like that creature before. He's not sure what to make of its warning. He knows he should leave, but he's not sure he's ready to abandon the research station. He's been working there for weeks, and he's made some good friends. He's not sure he's ready to leave them behind. He decides to drive back to the station and warn his friends about the creature. He knows they won't believe him, but he has to try. He drives closer to the station and can see the lights in the distance. He's about to pull up to the station when he sees something moving in the shadows. He can't quite make it out, but it looks like the creature. He's not sure what to do. He doesn't want to confront it again, but he knows he has to. He takes a deep breath and drives towards the creature. It comes into the light and he can see that it's the same creature. It's standing in the middle of the road, blocking his way. Wang stops the truck and gets out. "Hello again," he says. "I'm just trying to warn my friends. They need to leave this place. It's not safe here." The creature looks at him and shakes its head. "They won't listen to you," it says. "You need to leave now. This place is going to be destroyed." Wang is about to say something, but he's interrupted by a loud explosion. He looks up and sees the research station blowing up. Wang is in shock. He can't believe what he's seeing. The creature was right. This place is no longer safe. He knows he needs to leave. He climbs back into his truck and drives away.
