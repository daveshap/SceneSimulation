The waves continue to crash against the shore as Mashawn finishes his lunch. He leans back against the palm tree and closes his eyes, letting the breeze cool him off. He hears the sound of someone walking towards him and opens his eyes to see a woman approaching. She's wearing a brightly colored sundress and carrying a beach towel. She smiles at him as she walks by, and he can't help but smile back. She seems like she's enjoying the day just as much as he is.
