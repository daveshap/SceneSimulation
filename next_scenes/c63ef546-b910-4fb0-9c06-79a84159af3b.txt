She can't believe he's here, and she doesn't know how he got here. He tells her that he was captured by a group of people who were living in the forest. They were a strange people, and they wore strange clothing. He was able to escape and he's been walking for days, trying to find his way back to her. They sit down by the fire, and he tells her everything that happened to him. She can't believe what he's telling her, but she's just happy that he's alive and that they're together again.
