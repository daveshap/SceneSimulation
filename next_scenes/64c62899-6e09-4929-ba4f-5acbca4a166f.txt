Jenna's heart races as the ground continues to shake and the people around the fire start to panic. She hears someone yell, "The prophecy is coming true! She's here!" and she wonders what they could mean. Is she in danger? Jenna takes a step back towards the entrance of the cave, but before she can make her escape, the ground opens up and she falls into a deep pit. Jenna screams as she falls, but she's quickly engulfed by darkness and she loses consciousness. When Jenna wakes up, she's in a dark room lit by a single candle. She's lying on a bed, and she has a feeling she's being watched. Jenna sits up and looks around the room, but she doesn't see anyone. She gets up from the bed and crosses the room to the door, but when she tries to open it, she finds that it's locked. Jenna starts to feel panicky, and she starts to bang on the door, yelling for help. But no one comes. Jenna doesn't know what to do. She's trapped in this room, and she has no idea what's going to happen to her.
