Bob enters his coffee shop and begins to brew a pot of coffee. He thinks about his day as he works, replaying his walk under the Eifel Tower. He smiles to himself, thinking about how lucky he is to live in such a beautiful city. As he waits for the coffee to brew, Bob's mind turns to his business. He's been doing well lately, and he's been considering expanding. He's not sure if he's ready for the responsibility, but he's definitely been thinking about it. Bob pours himself a cup of coffee and sits down at one of the tables. He's looking forward to a quiet evening, just relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet of his shop.
