The sun has almost set by the time Gabbi finishes tucking the kids into bed. She takes a moment to listen to their soft breathing, enjoying the peace of the moment. Eventually, she heads back to the porch, where she finds herself drawn to the stars. She gazes up at them for a while, letting her mind wander. She thinks about the world beyond her little cottage and all the possibilities that exist out there. Maybe one day she'll get to see some of those places for herself. For now, though, she's content to sit on her porch and enjoy the quiet of the night.
