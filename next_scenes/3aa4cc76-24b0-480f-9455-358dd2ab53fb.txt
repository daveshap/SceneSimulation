The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was soothing, and the smell of the ocean was refreshing. Bob took a sip of his coffee and then bit into his sandwich, savoring the taste of the freshly-made bread. He watched as a group of children played in the sand nearby, their laughter filling the air. Further down the beach, he saw a couple walking hand in hand, enjoying the beautiful day. Bob smiled to himself, feeling grateful for this moment of peace.
