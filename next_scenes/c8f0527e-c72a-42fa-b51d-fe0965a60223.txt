Swathi's mind begins to drift as she relaxes on her bed. She thinks about her work day and all the things she still needs to do. She starts to feel overwhelmed and her muscles tense up. She opens her eyes and sits up, trying to shake off the negative feelings. She stands up and stretches her arms and legs, taking a few deep breaths. She walks over to her window and looks out at the city skyline. The sun is setting and the sky is a beautiful orange. She feels a bit better seeing the city in all its glory. She turns away from the window and decides to take a hot shower. She hopes the water will wash away her worries and help her relax. She strips off her clothes and steps into the shower, letting the hot water cascade over her body. Ah, that feels good. She takes her time and washes away the day, feeling her muscles relax even more. She gets out of the shower and dries off, feeling refreshed. She slips into a comfortable pair of pajamas and climbs into bed. She closes her eyes and takes a few deep breaths, letting her mind drift off into a peaceful sleep.
