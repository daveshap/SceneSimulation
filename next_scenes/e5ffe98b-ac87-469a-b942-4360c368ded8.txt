The man begins stocking the shelves in the back room, placing the various bottles of liquor in their respective spots. He works quickly and efficiently, and within a few minutes he is done. He comes back out to the main area of the bar, where Tom is still chatting with the customers. Tom sees the man and nods his head in approval. He tells the man to help him clean up the tables and chairs. The man nods and goes to work, wiping down the tables and chairs with a cloth. Within a few minutes, the bar is clean and orderly. Tom thanks the man for his help and tells him he can go. The man nods and walk out of the bar, back into the lunar colony.
