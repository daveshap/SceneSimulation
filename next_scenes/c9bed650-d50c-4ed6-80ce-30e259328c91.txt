The sun is setting, and Swathi is sitting on the beach watching the beautiful colours in the sky. She's thinking about her life and how grateful she is for what she has. She's also thinking about her future and what she wants to do with her life. She's been working as a software engineer for the past few years, but she's starting to feel like she's not doing what she really wants to do. She's beginning to think that maybe she wants to do something else with her life. She's not sure what, but she knows that she wants to make a change. As she watches the sun set, she thinks about all the possibilities for her future. She could stay in her current job, or she could explore other options. She could travel, or she could start her own business. The possibilities are endless, and she feels excited about the prospect of making a change in her life. She knows that it won't be easy to make a change, but she's ready to take the first steps. She's ready to explore her options and figure out what she really wants to do with her life.
