Sandy continues to watch the Earth rise, feeling both awe and wonder at the sight. She's never tired of seeing it, no matter how many times she's done it. She snaps a few pictures, wanting to capture the moment and share it with her friends back home. After a while, she starts to feel tired, and decides to head back to her base. She carefully packs up her camera and tripod, and starts the long walk back. The air is still and dusty, and Sandy can feel her heart pounding in her chest as she walks. She knows she needs to take it slow and steady in her space suit, but she can't help but feel a sense of urgency. Finally, she reaches her base and takes off her space suit. She's relieved to be back in the air-conditioned comfort of her home, and immediately sits down to download her pictures and share them with her friends.
