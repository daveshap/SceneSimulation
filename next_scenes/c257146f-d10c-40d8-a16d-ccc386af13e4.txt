Gabbi and the girl continue to drive across the lunar surface, pointing out various features of the landscape. They spot a large crater in the distance and make their way towards it. As they approach, they can see that the crater is much larger than they thought. It is so big that they can't see the other side. They spend some time exploring the crater and then make their way back to the rover.
