Bob wakes up slowly, the light filtering in through the window gradually getting brighter and brighter. He blinks a few times, letting his eyes adjust, and then sits up, stretch his arms above his head with a yawn. He gets out of bed, feeling refreshed and well-rested after his nap, and goes over to the mirror to take a look at himself. His hair is a little messy, but he doesn't mind. He gives himself a quick once-over, making sure he looks presentable, and then heads out of the room. As he walks down the hall, he can hear the sounds of his roommates moving around in the kitchen. He follows the noise, and sure enough, finds them both there, making breakfast. His stomach grumbles, and he realizes he's starving. He hadn't eaten anything since lunch yesterday. "Hey guys," he greets them, walking over to the fridge to see what they have. "What's for breakfast?"
