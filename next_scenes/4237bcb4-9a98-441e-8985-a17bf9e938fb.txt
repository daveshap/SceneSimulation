Wang walks back to his car, disappointed that he won't be able to make his delivery today. He gets in and starts the engine, then begins the drive home. On the way, he decides to stop at a restaurant for dinner. He orders his food and eats it quickly, then heads home. Once he arrives home, he takes his dog for a walk and then goes to bed. He sets his alarm for 6am so that he can get back to the office building tomorrow and make his delivery.
