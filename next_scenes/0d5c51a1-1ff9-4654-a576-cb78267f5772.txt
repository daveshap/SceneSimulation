Wang is sitting in his truck, eating his lunch and listening to the radio. He's frustrated that he can't make his delivery until after 5pm. He's about to take another bite of his sandwich when he sees a group of teenagers walking by. They look like they're up to no good. Wang watches as they approach the office building and start messing around with the front door. He's debating whether or not to intervene when he sees them pull out a slim jim and start trying to break into the building. Wang decides to take action. He jumps out of his truck and runs over to the group of teenagers. He starts yelling at them and telling them to stop. The teenagers are surprised and scared. They drop the slim jim and take off running. Wang is relieved that he was able to stop them from breaking into the building. He picks up the slim jim and goes back to his truck.
