Aleksy hesitated before entering the clearing, one hand still clutching the machete tight. He shone his flashlight around, trying to get a better look at the figures seated around the campfire. They were all dressed in long, hooded cloaks, and their faces were hidden in the shadows. "Who are you?" he asked warily. "And how do you know my name?" "We know many things, Aleksy," the figure closest to him said. "We know that you're looking for your missing sister. And we know that you've been wondering why she disappeared." "What do you know about my sister?" demanded Aleksy. "Where is she?" "That's something you'll have to find out for yourself," said the figure. "If you want to know the truth, you'll have to come with us." Aleksy hesitated, then nodded. He didn't know what these people were, but if they knew something about his sister, he was willing to go with them. He followed them deeper into the forest, the machete still clutched in one hand. He had a feeling he was going to need it.
