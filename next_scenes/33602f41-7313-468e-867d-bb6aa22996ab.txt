Gabbi sat on the edge of the bed, her heart pounding in her chest. She couldn't believe that the police had arrived just in time. She was shook up, but she was relieved that the man was gone. She slowly got to her feet, her legs trembling. She made her way to the window, peeking out to see the police officers talking to her neighbors. She was about to turn away when she saw the man in the shadows, watching her. Their eyes met, and Gabbi felt a cold chill run down her spine. She knew he was still out there, waiting for her. She was going to have to be careful from now on.
