Bob finishes cleaning up the shop and heads upstairs to his apartment. He unlocks the door and steps inside, flipping on the light as he goes. He heads into the kitchen and starts getting dinner ready. He cooks a pot of spaghetti and puts out a salad and some bread, then sits down to eat. After dinner, Bob watches a movie and relaxes for a bit. He knows the morning rush will be here before he knows it, and he wants to be ready for it. Before long, it's time for bed and Bob heads upstairs to his bedroom. He gets into bed and falls asleep, knowing the morning rush will be here before he knows it.
