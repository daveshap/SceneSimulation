Wang finishes unloading the boxes of food and closes the door to the truck. He looks around the warehouse and sees that it is mostly empty. He sees a few workers in the distance, moving around some of the crates. He starts to walk towards them, but before he can reach them, he hears a loud noise. He turns around and sees that the truck has exploded. He is thrown to the ground by the force of the explosion. He looks around and sees that the warehouse is now on fire. He hears the sound of people screaming. He gets up and starts to run towards the exit.
