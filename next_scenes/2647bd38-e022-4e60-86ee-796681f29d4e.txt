Gabbi finishes up her morning routine, then heads outside to enjoy the beautiful day. She takes a stroll around the property, admiring the flowers and the peacefulness of the countryside. After a while, she sits down on the porch swing and closes her eyes, letting the warm sun wash over her. She must doze off for a while, because the next thing she knows, she hears the sound of children laughing. She opens her eyes to see two little girls running around the yard, playing tag. They spot Gabbi and come running over, asking if she'll play with them. Gabbi happily agrees, and they spend the next hour or so playing games and chasing each other around. It's just what she needed to relax and forget about her troubles for a while.
