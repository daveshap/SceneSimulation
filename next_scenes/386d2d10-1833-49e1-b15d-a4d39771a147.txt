Swathi is being dragged through the forest by her captor. She's trying to fight and scream, but it's no use. She's gagged and tied up, and she can't see where she's being taken. She's terrified, and she has no idea what's going to happen to her. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like somebody is following them. Her captor starts to run, and Swathi is dragged behind him. She trips and falls, and she can see her captor getting further and further away. She's about to give up when she hears the noise again. This time, it sounds like it's getting closer. She starts to struggle again, and she manages to get loose. She runs in the opposite direction of her captor and she doesn't stop until she finds a road. She's exhausted and scared, but she's relieved to be out of the forest.
