Aleksy runs after the woman, his heart pounding in his chest. He knows he can't let those men hurt her. He catches up to her and grabs her arm, warning her that they're coming. The woman looks at him, terror in her eyes. She nods and they start to run together. The men are getting closer and Aleksy knows they won't be able to outrun them. He looks around, desperately trying to find a place to hide. He spots a small cave off the side of the beach and leads the woman towards it. They duck inside just as the men reach them. Aleksy's heart is racing as he listens to the men searching for them. Finally, they seem to give up and Aleksy and the woman breathe a sigh of relief. Aleksy turns to the woman and asks her what's going on. She tells him that she's being chased by a group of men who want to hurt her. Aleksy knows he can't just let them go, so he tells her to stay put while he goes to confront them. The woman nods and Aleksy leaves the safety of the cave.
