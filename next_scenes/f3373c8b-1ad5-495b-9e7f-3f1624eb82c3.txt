Gabbi is enjoying the concert and the moment, when suddenly the baby starts to cry. Gabbi tries to shush the baby, but it's no use. The baby is upset and agitated, and Gabbi decides she needs to take the baby out of the concert. Gabbi makes her way through the crowd, holding the crying baby close. She finds a quiet spot outside of the concert area and sits down with the baby. The baby eventually calms down and falls asleep in Gabbi's arms. Gabbi sits there and watches the concert from a distance, feeling grateful that she was able to still enjoy the music, even though the baby got upset.
