Jenna is running as fast as she can, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear the thing chasing her, crashing through the underbrush. It's getting closer and closer. She sees a clearing up ahead and sprints for it. She reaches the clearing and realizes too late that it's a dead end. She turns to face the thing, her heart in her throat. It's a huge, monstrous creature, covered in fur. It's eyes are glowing yellow, and it's dripping with saliva. It's coming for her, and she knows she's going to die.
