Tom is busy cleaning up the bar as closing time approaches. He wipes down the counter, sweeps the floor and prepares for the next day. He's looking forward to another busy shift tomorrow. The customers are all leaving the bar, laughing and joking. They all say goodbye to Tom and thank him for their drinks. They head out into the city, looking for their next adventure. Tom finishes up his cleaning and locks the door to the bar. He heads home, looking forward to a good night's sleep.
