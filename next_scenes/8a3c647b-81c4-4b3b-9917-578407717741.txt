Wang trudges back through the village, his strength depleted from the long journey. He is glad to have made the delivery safely, but he is exhausted. He stops at the village well to drink and refill his canteen. He eats a little more of the food he has with him. He sits for a few minutes to rest, but he knows he must keep moving. He stands and starts walking again. He makes his way through the village and out into the wilderness. He walks for several hours, stopping only briefly to rest and drink. Finally, he sees the lights of the village in the distance. He knows he is almost home. He quickens his pace, eager to get back to his family. He arrives at his home, weary but safe. He is greeted by his wife and children. They help him inside and give him something to eat and drink. He is happy to be home and safe with his family.
