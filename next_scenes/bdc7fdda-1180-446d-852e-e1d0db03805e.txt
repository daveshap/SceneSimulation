Tom slowly opened his eyes, expecting to see the drooling jaws of the creature bearing down on him. But instead, he found himself lying on the forest floor, with the sun shining down through the trees. He must have been dreaming, he thought to himself. But then he saw the creature's dead body lying next to him, its throat ripped open. And he saw the strange, furry creature standing over him, its mouth bloody. Tom realized that he was not dreaming after all. The creature had saved his life.
