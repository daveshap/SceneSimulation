The sun is beginning to set, and the air is cooling off. Sandy is still sitting at the table, but she's starting to feel a little bit chilly. She's got a blanket wrapped around her, and she's enjoying the peace and quiet. The birds are still singing, and the view is just as beautiful as it was earlier. Sandy's phone rings again, and she sees that it's her husband again. He's asking if she's coming home soon, and she tells him she's not sure. She's enjoying the peace and quiet of the mountaintop, and she doesn't want to leave just yet. her husband tells her to enjoy the rest of her evening, and he'll see her when she gets home. Sandy hangs up the phone and continues to enjoy the quiet evening on the mountaintop.
