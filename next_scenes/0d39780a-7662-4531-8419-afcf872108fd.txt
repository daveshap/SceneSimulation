It's now nighttime, and the stars are shining bright overhead. The fireflies have all disappeared, and the only sound is the gentle rustling of the leaves in the breeze. Swathi is still sitting on the porch, and she's starting to feel a bit sleepy. She's had a long day of travel and she's ready to drift off into a peaceful slumber. She takes one last sip of her tea and then sets the cup down on the porch railing. She stands up and stretches her arms overhead, taking a deep breath of the cool night air. Then she heads inside the cottage, ready to call it a day.
