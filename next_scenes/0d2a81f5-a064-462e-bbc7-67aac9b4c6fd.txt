Bob slowly opens his eyes, trying to make sense of the scene around him. He's disoriented and confused, and it takes him a moment to realize he's lying at the bottom of the mountain. Bob tries to get up, but he's in a lot of pain. He looks around and sees the creature standing a few feet away from him, still making that strange noise. Bob's heart starts to race as he realizes he's in serious trouble. The creature starts to move closer to him, and Bob starts to crawl away. But he's in too much pain and he can't move very fast. The creature is getting closer and closer, and Bob knows he's not going to make it. He's about to give up when he hears someone calling his name. He looks up and sees a group of people standing at the edge of the clearing. They've obviously seen the creature and they're trying to get Bob's attention. Bob tries to cry out to them, but he's too weak. The creature is almost on top of him now, and Bob knows he's going to die. But then he hears a gunshot and the creature falls to the ground, dead. Bob's rescuers rush to his side and help him up. They've killed the creature, but Bob will never forget what he's seen.
