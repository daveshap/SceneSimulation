Gabbi helps the children brush their teeth and hair, and then gets them dressed in their clothes. After that, Gabbi gives the children breakfast and helps them eat. Once the children are finished, Gabbi cleans up their mess and then takes them outside to play. The children run around the yard, laughing and playing games. Gabbi keeps a watchful eye on them, making sure they stay safe. After a while, the children start to get tired, so Gabbi gathers them up and takes them back inside. She helps them wash their hands and faces, and then gets them ready for their nap. Once the children are asleep, Gabbi tidies up the house and does some light cleaning. After a few hours, the children wake up and Gabbi starts playing with them again. As the day comes to an end, Gabbi helps the children get ready for bed. She reads them a story, tucks them in, and kisses them goodnight. Once the children are asleep, Gabbi cleans up the house and prepares to go home.
