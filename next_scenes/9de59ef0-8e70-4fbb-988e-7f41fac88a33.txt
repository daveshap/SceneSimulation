The person who enters the room is Jenna's boss. He is a tall, heavyset man with a balding head and a stern expression. He is carrying a stack of papers in one hand and a coffee mug in the other. Jenna's heart sinks as she realizes she is going to be in for a long meeting. Her boss starts to speak, but Jenna cuts him off. She knows she needs to buy herself some time. She tells him that she is almost finished with the project and just needs a few more minutes. Her boss looks skeptical, but Jenna is adamant. She pleads with him to give her just five more minutes, and her boss finally relents. He tells her that he will be back in five minutes, and then he leaves the office, closing the door behind him. Jenna lets out a sigh of relief and returns to her work. She knows she doesn't have much time, but she is determined to finish the project before her boss returns.
