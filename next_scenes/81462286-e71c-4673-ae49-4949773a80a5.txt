The band finishes their set and the crowd goes wild, cheering and clapping. Mashawn puts down his beer and joins in, whooping and hollering. He's sweating from dancing and he's got a big grin on his face. The band starts to play an encore and Mashawn gets back into position, ready to rock out some more.
