Aleksy stepped off the elevator onto the top of the Eiffel Tower, immediately greeted by a gust of wind. He held onto his hat as he walked to the edge of the platform, the city sprawled out before him. He could see for miles in every direction, the buildings and streets forming a patchwork of colors. He took a deep breath and smiled, feeling grateful to finally be here. He spent the next hour walking around the platform, taking in the different views of the city. He take photos on his phone, and bought a souvenir Eiffel Tower keychain from the gift shop. Finally, it was time to go back down. He got back in the elevator and rode it back to the ground, where he began the walk back to his apartment.
