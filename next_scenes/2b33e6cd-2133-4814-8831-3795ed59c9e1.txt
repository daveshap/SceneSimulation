The group of tourists come up to the shop and start to unload their gear. Bob can see that they're all tired from the hike up the mountain. He knows they're going to be thirsty and he's got just the thing for them. He's got a big pot of coffee on the stove and he's already getting some cups out. He knows they're going to want to sit down and relax, so he gets some chairs out for them. They all sit down and Bob starts pouring the coffee. They all take a cup and they all thank him. They all take a sip of the coffee and they all smile. They all sit back in their chairs and they all start to talk. They're all excited to be up on the mountain and they're all excited to see Bob's shop again. They all start to ask him about his business and how he's doing. He tells them all about his business and how he's doing. He's doing pretty well, but he's always looking for ways to improve. He's always looking for new customers and he's always looking for new products. He's always looking for ways to make his shop better. The group of tourists listen to him and they all nod their heads. They all agree that he's doing a great job. They all finish their coffee and they all stand up. They all thank Bob for the coffee and they all start to leave. They all say they'll see him tomorrow and they all wave goodbye. Bob waves back and he watches them as they walk down the path. He's glad they came up to his shop and he knows they're going to be good customers.
