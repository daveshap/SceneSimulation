Mashawn's eyes widen as he realizes the speedboat is headed straight for the shore. He starts to run towards the water, but he knows he won't make it in time. The boat is getting closer and closer, and Mashawn can see the people on board are panicked. He waves his arms and yells, but they can't hear him over the sound of the motor. The boat is only a few feet away from the shore when Mashawn makes a desperate dive for it. He grabs the edge of the boat and hangs on as it speeds away.
