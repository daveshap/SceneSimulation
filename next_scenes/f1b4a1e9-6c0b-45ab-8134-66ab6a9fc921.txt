Finally, at 6pm, Jenna's boss arrives. He's a heavyset man in a cheap suit, and he looks like he's sweating. He mops his brow with a handkerchief as he comes over to Jenna. "Hey, sorry I'm late," he says. " traffic was a nightmare." Jenna just shrugs. She's used to her boss being late. "So, what do you have for me tonight?" he asks. "Just some paperwork," Jenna replies. "Nothing too exciting." Her boss sighs. "Well, let's get to it then." He leads Jenna into his office, and she gets to work.
