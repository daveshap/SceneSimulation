Sarah and Jenna finish catching up and say their goodbyes. Jenna starts to walk away when Sarah remembers something. "Hey Jenna! I almost forgot. I have something for you!" Jenna turns back around and asks what it is. Sarah reaches into her backpack and pulls out a small wooden box. "I got this for you in Kenya. I thought you might like it." Jenna takes the box from Sarah and opens it. Inside is a beautiful wooden necklace with a small charm in the shape of Africa. Jenna's eyes light up as she puts the necklace on. "Thank you so much, Sarah! I love it!" The two friends say one last goodbye and Jenna continues on her walk.
