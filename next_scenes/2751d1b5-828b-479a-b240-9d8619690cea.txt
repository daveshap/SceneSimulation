Jenna sits by the fire, trying to think of a way to get home. She's never been this far from home before, and she has no idea how to get back. She looks at the people around the fire and wonders if they can help her. She gets up and walks over to them. She points to herself and then points to the woods. She makes a walking motion with her fingers. The people look at her and then start to speak in their language. Jenna doesn't understand. She points to herself again and then points to the woods. She makes the walking motion again. The people look at her and then one of them gets up and starts to walk away. Jenna doesn't know what to do, so she follows him. He leads her to a small hut on the edge of the camp. He points to the hut and then points to Jenna. Jenna understands that he wants her to go inside. She hesitates for a moment, but then she goes inside.
