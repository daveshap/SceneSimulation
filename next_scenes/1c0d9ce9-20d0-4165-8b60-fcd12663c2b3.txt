The closer Jenna gets to the object, the more certain she becomes that it is indeed a spaceship. She begins to run even faster, her heart pounding in excitement. As she gets closer, she can see that the ship is in good condition, with no signs of damage. It's definitely not one of the old ships that were used in the early days of space travel. Jenna reaches the ship and stands next to it, admiring its sleek design. She can't believe her luck! She's never seen a ship like this before. After a few moments, she decides to try to board the ship. She tries the door, but it's locked. She looks around for a way to get inside, but there doesn't seem to be any other way in. She decides to wait and see if anyone comes out of the ship.
