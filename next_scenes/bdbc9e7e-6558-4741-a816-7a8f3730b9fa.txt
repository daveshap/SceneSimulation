Wang is getting ready for his next delivery. He dons his space suit and checks all his equipment. He steps into the airlock chamber and the door is sealed shut behind him. The chamber depressurizes and he feels his ears pop. He waits for the pressure to equalize before the door opens and he's let into the outpost. He's given a tour of the facility and shown to his quarters. He settles in and prepares for his next delivery.
