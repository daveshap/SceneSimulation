Gabbi slowly approaches the campfire, her heart pounding in her chest. She can't believe she's finally found her way out of the forest. The people around the campfire look up as she approaches. They look relieved to see her. "Thank goodness you're here," one of them says. "We were starting to worry." Gabbi can't help but smile. She's never been so happy to see other people. They help her sit down by the fire and give her something to eat and drink. She's exhausted, but she feels much better now that she's out of the forest. "Thank you so much for helping me," she says to the group. "Don't worry about it," one of them replies. "We're just glad you're safe."
