The sound of the waves grew louder and Swathi felt the sand shifting beneath her as the tide came in. She watched as the children ran back to the shore, their laughter carrying on the wind. The sun was still high in the sky, but the waves were now crashing against the rocks, sending spray into the air. Swathi sat for a while longer, letting the sound of the waves wash over her. Eventually, she got up and brushed the sand off her legs. It was time to get back to work.
