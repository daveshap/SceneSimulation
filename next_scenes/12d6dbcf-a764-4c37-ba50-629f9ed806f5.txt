The intruder continues to search the house, rifling through drawers and cabinets. Jenna lies on the couch, helpless and terrified. She can only watch as the intruder goes through her things, looking for something. She has no idea what he's looking for, or what he'll do to her when he finds it. She knows she's in serious trouble, and she's desperate for someone to come and help her. She can hear the intruder moving around the house, and she prays that he'll find whatever he's looking for and leave before it's too late. Suddenly, Jenna hears footsteps outside. Someone is coming to the house! She's filled with hope and desperation. She knows that whoever it is, they might be able to save her. She starts to struggle against her bonds, trying to make noise and get the intruder's attention. But he's too focused on his search, and he doesn't hear her. Jenna can only watch as the footsteps come closer and closer, until whoever it is is right outside the door. She hears a key in the lock, and she knows her salvation is here. But just as the door starts to open, the intruder comes back into the room and sees what's happening. He knows he's running out of time. He grabs Jenna and puts a hand over her mouth to silence her, then he drags her into the kitchen. Jenna is filled with terror. She knows the intruder is going to kill her. She can only wait and hope that someone will find her before it's too late.
