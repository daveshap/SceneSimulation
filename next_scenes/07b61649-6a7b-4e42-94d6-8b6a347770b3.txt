Swathi is making her way through the crowd, trying to stay on her feet as people are jostling and pushing all around her. She can see the exit sign, and she's determined to make it to the door. Finally, she manages to break free from the crowd and step out into the fresh air. The concert is over, but Swathi's night is just beginning. She's exhilarated from the experience, and she knows that she's just going to have to find another show to take her mind off of what happened.
