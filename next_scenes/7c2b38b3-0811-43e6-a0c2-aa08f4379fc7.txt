Jenna got out of bed and walked to her window, looking out at the city. The streets were busy with people walking and cars driving. Jenna saw the skyline in the distance and the tall buildings reaching up into the sky. She took a deep breath and felt thankful to be alive and living in such a beautiful city. She turned away from the window and went to her closet, picking out a light summer dress to wear. She slipped into the dress and put on her sandals, then grabbed her purse and keys. She left her apartment and walked down the street, enjoying the warm weather and the feel of the sun on her skin. Jenna walked for a while, exploring the city and taking in the sights and sounds. She eventually came to a park and sat down on a bench, people watching and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.
