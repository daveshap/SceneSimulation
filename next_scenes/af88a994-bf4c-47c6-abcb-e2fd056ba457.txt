Suddenly, Sandy feels a tap on her shoulder. She turns to see a tall, handsome man smiling down at her. He extends his hand and helps her to her feet. "Would you like to dance?" he asks. Sandy smiles and takes his hand. They move onto the dance floor, where they join the other couples who are swaying to the music. The man puts his arm around Sandy's waist and she leans into him, closing her eyes and enjoying the feel of his body against hers. They dance for a few minutes, lost in their own world, before the man leans down and whispers in Sandy's ear. "I've been watching you all night and I just had to tell you that you're the most beautiful woman in the room." Sandy blushes and smiles up at him. "Thank you," she says. The man leans in and kisses her, soft and sweet at first, but then with more passion. Sandy responds eagerly, wrapping her arms around his neck. They continue to kiss until the song comes to an end and they finally pull apart, both smiling. "I'll see you later," the man says, before walking away. Sandy stands there for a moment, feeling giddy and happy. She can't believe what just happened! She's sure this night is going to be one she'll never forget.
