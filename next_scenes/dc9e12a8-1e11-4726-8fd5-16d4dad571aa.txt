Jenna was starting to get hungry, so she reached into her bag and pulled out her sandwich. She unwrapped it and took a bite, savoring the taste of the fresh bread and turkey. As she ate, she watched the people around her. She saw a group of children building a sandcastle and a couple walking hand in hand. She smiled and took another bite of her sandwich.
