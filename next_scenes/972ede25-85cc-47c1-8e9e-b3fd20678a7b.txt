Aleksy finishes his shift at the grocery store and walks back home. He takes the same peaceful path through the countryside, enjoying the fresh air and the sound of the birds chirping. He arrives at his house and goes inside. He finds his wife in the kitchen, preparing dinner. They chat for a while and then sit down to eat. After dinner, they spend some time relaxing in the living room. Aleksy's wife reads a book while he listens to music. Eventually, they both head to bed. Aleksy's wife falls asleep quickly, but Aleksy has trouble falling asleep. He tosses and turns for a while, then gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen for a glass of water. As he's drinking his water, he hears a noise outside. He goes to the window and looks out. He sees a large animal moving around in the darkness. He can't tell what it is, but it looks big and dangerous. He quickly goes back to bed and tries to fall asleep, but he can't stop thinking about the animal outside.
