Jenna spends the morning walking around the city, taking in all the sights. She starts at the Eiffel Tower, then walks to the Louvre Museum. She spends a few hours there, admiring the artwork and thinking about her parents. After the Louvre, she grabs a quick bite to eat at a nearby cafe, then spends the afternoon walking around Notre Dame Cathedral and the Champs-Elysees. She does some shopping, buys a few souvenirs, and enjoys a gelato before heading back to her hotel. Jenna is exhausted from all the walking, but she's had an amazing day. She can't wait to see what tomorrow brings.
