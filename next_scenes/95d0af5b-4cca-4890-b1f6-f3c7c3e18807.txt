Wang climbs back into his car and drives down the winding country road. The sun is now setting behind the trees, casting a golden glow over everything. Wang turns on the radio and hums along to the song playing. He approaches a fork in the road and takes the left path. After a few minutes, he arrives at a small lake. He pulls over to the side of the road and gets out of the car. He walks over to the edge of the lake and looks out at the water. The surface is calm and smooth, like a sheet of glass. Wang takes a deep breath of the cool, fresh air and feels his muscles start to relax. He sits down on the grass and watches as the sun continues to set. The sky turns from orange to purple, and the stars begin to come out. Wang looks up at the stars and wonders what it would be like to live in a place like this. He eventually falls asleep and doesn't wake up until the sun is rising the next morning.
