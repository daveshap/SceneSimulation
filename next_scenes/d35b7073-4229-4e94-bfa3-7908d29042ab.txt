Jenna lay on the ground, trying to catch her breath. She could hear the sound of the building collapsing all around her and the screams of the people who were still inside. She was in pain and could feel a warm liquid running down her face. She reached up and felt her head, and her hand came away covered in blood. She tried to move, but her leg was trapped under a piece of debris. She was trapped and injured, and she knew she wasn't going to be able to get out on her own. She lay there for a while, waiting for someone to come and help her. She could feel herself getting weaker and she knew she was going to pass out soon. She thought about her family and how she was never going to see them again. She said a prayer and then everything went black.
