The figure drags Swathi into the bushes, her screams echoing through the air. She struggles against her captor, but it is no use. He is too strong. He covers her mouth with his hand to muffle her screams and wraps his other arm around her waist, restraining her. She continues to struggle, but eventually she tires and goes limp in his arms. He drags her further into the bushes, away from the path. He lays her down on the ground and ties her hands and feet with rope, making sure she is securely bound. Then he gags her with a piece of cloth, to prevent her from screaming. He looks at her scared, helpless face and feels a twinge of guilt, but he pushes it aside. He has a job to do. He stands up and walks away, leaving her alone in the darkness.
