Mashawn continues shoveling snow back into place, trying to block out the sight of the damage the boulder did. He knows that it'll be a long day, and he won't be able to finish before dark. He pauses for a minute to eat some lunch, and then gets back to work. The sun starts to set, and Mashawn is still working. He's exhausted, but he knows he has to finish. Finally, he's done. He steps back to survey his work and is pleased with what he sees. The wall is finished, and it looks just as he imagined it would. He's proud of his work, and can't wait to show it off to his friends and family.
