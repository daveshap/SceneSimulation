Jenna gazes up at the Earth, hanging in the sky like a huge blue-green marble. She takes a bite of her sandwich and chews thoughtfully, wondering what her life would be like if she were there, instead of here on the moon. She's always dreamed of visiting Earth, but it seems so far away and unattainable. Suddenly, Jenna feels a tap on her shoulder. She turns around to see a tall woman with long, silver hair standing behind her. The woman smiles and extends her hand. "Hello, Jenna," she says in a musical voice. "My name is Selene. I'm here to take you to Earth." Jenna's eyes widen in disbelief. She takes Selene's hand and stands up from the bench. Selene waves her hand and a shimmering portal opens up in the air. Jenna takes a deep breath and steps through, into the unknown.
