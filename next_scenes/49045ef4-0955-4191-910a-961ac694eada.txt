Wang awoke to the sound of someone calling his name. He sat up and saw his friend, Li, walking towards him. Li was carrying a fishing rod and a bucket of bait. "Hey, Wang! I thought I'd find you here. I'm going to go fishing. Care to join me?" Wang was tempted, but he knew he had to get back to work. "I wish I could, Li, but I have to finish my deliveries. Maybe another time." Li shrugged. "Suit yourself. I'll see you later." Wang watched as Li walked down to the water's edge and began to set up his gear. He envied his friend, being able to spend the afternoon relaxing and fishing. Maybe one day he would have the time to do that himself. For now, he had to get back to work. He stood up and brushed the sand off his clothes. Then he picked up his scooter and went back to work.
