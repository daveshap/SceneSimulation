Sandy is standing in the middle of the packed concert hall, lost in the music. She's swaying back and forth, her eyes closed and a smile on her face. She's surrounded by people who are all dancing and singing along to the band on stage. The atmosphere is electric and Sandy is loving every minute of it. She's not thinking about anything else, just letting the music wash over her and enjoying the moment.
