As Tom continues walking, he hears the monkey chattering away excitedly on his shoulder. The sound of the monkey's voice is a welcome relief in the darkness of the forest. Tom knows he needs to keep moving, but he can't help but feel a sense of unease at the prospect of what he might find in the depths of the forest. He has no idea what he's going to find, but he knows he needs to be prepared for anything. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap in the distance. He freezes, listening intently. It could be an animal, or it could be someone waiting to ambush him. He carefully reaches into his pocket and grips his knife tightly, just in case. The branch snapping gets closer, and Tom can see a figure moving towards him through the darkness. He relaxes slightly when he realizes it's just a small deer. The deer stops in front of Tom and looks at him with its large, dark eyes. Tom feels a sense of calm wash over him. He knows he needs to keep moving, but he can't help but feel thankful for the company of the small deer.
