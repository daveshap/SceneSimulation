Bob slowly opens the door to the storage room and peers inside. He sees a figure rummaging through the boxes. The figure is wearing a black hoodie and has their face covered. Bob can't tell if it is a man or a woman. He raises the bat and prepares to swing. The figure hears him and turns around. Bob swings the bat, but the figure ducks and the bat hits the wall. The figure charges at Bob and tackles him to the ground. Bob drops the bat and it clatters to the floor. The figure starts to punch him in the face. Bob tries to fight back, but the figure is too strong. The figure gets up and starts to walk away. Bob is lying on the floor, beaten and bruised. He watches as the figure disappears out the door. He knows he should call the police, but he is too shaken up to move. He decides to wait until morning.
