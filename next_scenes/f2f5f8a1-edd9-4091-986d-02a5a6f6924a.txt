The sun slowly sets over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the sky. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is blowing through the leaves. Bob is sitting on the porch of his country cottage, sipping a cup of coffee and enjoying the peaceful evening. He looks out at the beautiful scenery and feels thankful for the peace and quiet.
