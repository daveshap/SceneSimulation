The next morning, Swathi wakes up to the sound of her alarm. She lazily gets out of bed, feeling a bit groggy from sleep. She walks into the bathroom and starts her morning routine by brushing her teeth and washing her face. She then walks into the kitchen, where she makes herself a cup of coffee. She sits down at the kitchen table and starts to drink her coffee, scrolling through her phone. She checks her email and social media, and sees that she has a few work emails that she needs to respond to. She starts to type out responses, sipping her coffee in between. After a few minutes, she finishes her coffee and gets up from the table. She walks into her bedroom and gets dressed for work, picking out a nice blouse and a skirt. She then grab her purse and keys and head out the door, ready to start her day.
