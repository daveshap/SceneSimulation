Mashawn continues to sit on the porch, enjoying the quiet morning. He takes another sip of coffee and stretches his arms overhead. He hears a car driving down the road and wonders who it could be this early in the morning. The car pulls into the driveway and Mashawn recognizes it as his neighbor's car. His neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, gets out of the car and waves. Mashawn waves back and calls out to her, asking what she's doing out so early. Mrs. Johnson replies that she's on her way to work and asks Mashawn how his day is going. Mashawn tells her that he's just enjoying the peaceful morning and getting ready for the day ahead. Mrs. Johnson says goodbye and drives off. Mashawn goes back to enjoying the quiet morning.
