The woman, who is Wang's girlfriend, is shocked to see him asleep in the middle of the afternoon. She had come home to surprise him, but it seems he was taking a nap instead. The room is a mess, with clothes and garbage strewn about, and the strong smell of cigarettes hangs in the air. Wang's girlfriend wakes him up and starts to yell at him for being so lazy. He tries to explain that he was just taking a quick nap, but she doesn't believe him. She starts to throw things at him, and he tries to dodge them. Finally, she storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her.
