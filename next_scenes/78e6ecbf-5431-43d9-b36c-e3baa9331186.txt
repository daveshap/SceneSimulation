Jenna walks back to her hotel, feeling happy and relaxed. She walks through the lobby, past the front desk, and down the hall to her room. She unlocks the door and steps inside, taking a deep breath and feeling the cool air of the air conditioning. She kicks off her shoes and flops down onto the bed, letting out a contented sigh. She stares up at the ceiling, still feeling the peacefulness of the beach. Slowly, her eyes start to droop, and she feels herself starting to drift off to sleep. She has a pleasant dream about surfing with Damien, riding the waves and feeling the salty spray on her skin. She wakes up a few hours later, feeling refreshed and well-rested. She gets up and stretches, taking a deep breath and feeling the new day ahead of her.
