Sandy's lifeless body lies on the ground, her eyes wide open and unseeing. The snake is still wrapped around her, its body now swollen with Sandy's blood. Mia sits beside her mother's body, crying and trying to wake her up. She doesn't understand what has happened and why her mother isn't moving. After a while, Mia's cries start to fade as exhaustion takes over. She curls up next to her mother's body and falls asleep. The sun rises slowly, casting a faint light over the forest. Sandy's body is starting to stiffen and the color is draining from her skin. Mia is still asleep, her head pillowed on Sandy's chest. A small fly lands on Sandy's open eye and starts to crawl around. Mia stirs and slowly opens her eyes. She sees the fly on her mother's face and brushes it away. She looks around, confusion and fear etched on her little face. Sandy's body is cold and there is a strange smell in the air. Mia starts to cry again, her sobs echoing in the silence of the forest.
