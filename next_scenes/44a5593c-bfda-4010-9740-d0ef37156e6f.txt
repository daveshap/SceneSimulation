Tom finishes up his shift and heads to his own room, tired but happy. He kicks off his shoes and flops down onto the bed, letting out a long sigh. It's been a long night, but it's been a good one. He's glad he could help make everyone's experience at the lodge a good one. He closes his eyes, letting the sounds of the wilderness lull him to sleep. Tomorrow is another day and there's always more work to be done, but for now, he just relaxes and lets the fatigue wash over him.
