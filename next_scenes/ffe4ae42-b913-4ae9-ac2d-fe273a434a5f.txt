Gabbi screams for help as the teenagers drag her away, but no one comes to her aid. She struggles to free herself from their grip, but they are too strong. They drag her to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Gabbi pleads with them to let her go, but they only laugh. The leader of the group, a tall boy with dark hair, steps forward. "We're going to have some fun with you, babysitter." He pulls a knife from his pocket and Gabbi screams. The boy steps forward and slits her throat. As she lay dying, Gabbi hears the sound of laughter echoing in her mind.
