Jenna walks down the hallway, her footsteps echoing in the silence. She goes down the stairs and into the kitchen, where she finds her mother already up and making breakfast. Jenna greets her mother and sits down at the table, where her mother puts a plate of pancakes in front of her. Jenna begins to eat, and after a few minutes, her mother asks her how she slept. Jenna says she slept well and thanks her mother for the pancakes. Her mother tells her it's no problem and that she should get going soon if she wants to make it to school on time. Jenna finishes her breakfast, then puts her plate in the sink and goes to grab her backpack. She gives her mother a hug and a kiss on the cheek, then heads out the door and down the street to school.
