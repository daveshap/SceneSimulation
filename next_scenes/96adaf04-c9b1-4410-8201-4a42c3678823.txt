Wang is running as fast as he can, but he knows he won't be able to outrun whatever is chasing him. He can hear its footsteps pounding the ground behind him, getting closer and closer. He knows he's in trouble. He sees a light in the distance and he knows he has to reach it. It's his only chance. He's getting tired, but he doesn't dare stop. He can hear the thing behind him, its breath hot on his neck. He's about to give up, but then he hears someone calling his name. He knows he has to keep going. He's almost there. He can see the light now, and he knows he's going to make it.
