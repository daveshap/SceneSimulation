Mashawn finishes putting away his tools and starts sweeping the floor. He doesn't want to leave any trace of his work behind. He knows the cleaning crew will take care of the rest, but he wants to leave the area as clean as possible. He finishes sweeping and heads to the door. He pauses for a moment, looking back at his work area. He's proud of what he's accomplished today. Even though it's just a small part of the overall project, he knows he's made a difference. He leaves the building and heads to his car. He's looking forward to getting home and spending time with his family. He's been working long hours lately, and he knows they've missed him. He gets in his car and starts the drive home. He's tired, but he's happy. He knows he's made a difference today, and that's all that matters.
