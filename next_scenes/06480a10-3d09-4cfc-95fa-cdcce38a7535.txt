The sun continues to beat down on the savannah as the group finishes their meal. Bob takes a moment to stretch and enjoy the company of his friends before getting back to work. He says goodbye to his friends and heads back to the coffee shop. The inside of the coffee shop is a welcome respite from the heat of the day. The air is cooler and the smell of coffee wafts through the air. Bob gets to work preparing for the afternoon rush. He grinds beans, brews coffee, and gets the pastries ready for the customers. As the afternoon rush starts, Bob is busy serving customers and making coffee. The shop is busy with people coming in and out, and Bob is in his element. He loves chatting with his customers and getting to know them. The hours fly by and soon it is time to close up shop. Bob finishes up his closing duties and heads back out into the heat of the day. He takes a moment to admire the sunset before heading home for the evening.
