Wang drives away from the office building as fast as he can. His heart is pounding in his chest and he can barely think straight. He knows he needs to find a police station and tell them what he saw. He drives for a few blocks before he sees a police station. He pulls into the parking lot and jumps out of his car. He runs into the building and up to the counter. The officer behind the counter looks up at him. Wang is out of breath and he can't speak. The officer asks him what is wrong. Wang tries to gasp out that there was a robbery at the office building but he can't get the words out. The officer tells him to calm down and take a deep breath. Wang does as he is told and after a few moments, he is able to speak. He tells the officer what he saw and where the office building is. The officer thanks him for the information and tells him he will send a unit to the building right away. Wang nods and then turns and leaves the station. He gets back in his car and drives home. He is shaken up by the whole ordeal but he is glad that he was able to help the police.
