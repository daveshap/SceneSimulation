Mashawn and the girl walk out of the concert venue hand-in-hand. The girl is visibly shaken and looks relieved to be out of the crowd. Mashawn leads her to his car and opens the door for her. She gets in and he fastens her seatbelt for her. He gets in the driver's seat and starts the car. He drives out of the parking lot and onto the road. The girl gives him directions to her house. Along the way, they make small talk. The girl tells Mashawn that her name is Sarah. Sarah thanks Mashawn for his help and tells him that she had a really bad feeling about being in that crowd by herself. They pull up to Sarah's house and she invites Mashawn in for a drink. He politely declines and says that he needs to get home. Sarah thanks him again and gets out of the car. Mashawn watches her go into her house and then drives away.
