The coffee shop is still busy, but it's starting to slow down as the night goes on. Bob is still making coffee and serving customers, but he's starting to feel a bit tired. He's glad that his shop is still busy, but he's looking forward to closing up for the night. The customers are starting to thin out now, and Bob is starting to get ready to close up shop. He's cleaning off the counters and putting the cups away. He's about to turn off the lights when he hears a loud crash. He turns around and sees that one of the customers has knocked over a display of coffee mugs. The customer is apologetic, but Bob is just glad that nobody was hurt. He helps the customer clean up the mess, and then he finally closes up shop for the night.
