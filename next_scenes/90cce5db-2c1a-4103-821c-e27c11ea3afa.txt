Jenna lays in her bed for a few more minutes, contemplating her life and what she should do. She's restless and she can't seem to find a comfortable position. She gets out of bed and walks over to her dresser. She pulls out a pair of jeans and a shirt and gets dressed. She takes her phone and wallet off the nightstand and stuffs them into her pocket. She walks to her door and opens it, stepping out into the hallway. She's never done anything like this before, but she's fed up with her life. She's going to go out and find something more. She walks down the hallway and towards the front door. She can hear her parents snoring from their bedroom and she knows they won't wake up. She's never been a rebellious person, but she doesn't care anymore. She wants to experience life and she's not going to let anything stop her. She opens the front door and steps outside. She pauses for a moment, looking back at her house. She wonders if she'll ever see it again. She knows she needs to leave, but she can't help but feel a little sad. She takes a deep breath and starts walking down the street. She has no idea where she's going, but she knows she'll find something more out there.
