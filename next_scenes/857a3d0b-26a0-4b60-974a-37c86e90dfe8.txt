Swathi awoke to the sound of someone calling her name. She felt a sharp pain in her head and struggled to open her eyes. When she finally managed to open them, she saw that she was lying on the ground surrounded by debris. The Eifel Tower was still crumbling in the distance, and she could hear the screams of the tourists. Slowly, she sat up, wincing at the pain in her head. She saw a figure walking towards her through the debris and recognized it as one of the tourists. "Are you okay?" the woman asked, concern etched on her face. Swathi nodded, gingerly touching the back of her head. "I think so," she said. "What happened?" "I don't know," the woman replied. "We were just standing there and then the ground started shaking. The next thing I knew, the tower was collapsing." Swathi slowly got to her feet and looked around. The scene was one of devastation, with pieces of the tower strewn everywhere. She saw people running and crying, and the air was thick with dust and debris. Suddenly, she realized that she had lost her laptop and her phone in the chaos. "Come on," the woman said, taking her arm. "We need to get out of here." Swathi nodded and followed her as they made their way through the debris. They finally reached the safety of a nearby building and stepped inside. Swathi leaned against a wall, her heart pounding in her chest. She had never seen anything like this in her life, and she could hardly believe that she had survived.
