The sun continues to rise, casting an ever-warm glow over the city. The streets bustle with people going about their day. Bob expertly makes each coffee, chatting with his customers as they wait. Business is good today - the line is out the door. Bob is in his element, making coffee and brightening people's days. However, there is one customer who seems to be causing a scene. This customer, who we will call 'A', is demanding and rude, and is causing a bit of a stir. Bob does his best to calm the customer down, but it seems to be falling on deaf ears. Finally, after a few minutes of arguing, Bob has had enough. He asks the customer to leave, and 'A' angrily stomps out of the shop. The other customers in line applaud Bob for his handling of the situation, and he goes back to making coffee with a smile on his face.
