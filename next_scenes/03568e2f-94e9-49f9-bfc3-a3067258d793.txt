Wang drives as fast as he can down the mountain, his heart pounding in his chest. He can hear the dog barking and growling, getting closer and closer. He knows he won't be able to outrun the dog for long. He has to think of something fast. Suddenly, he has an idea. He veers off the road and drives into a nearby field. The dog follows him. Wang drives towards a large tree in the middle of the field. He gets out of the truck and runs around to the other side of the tree, with the dog close behind him. He waits until the dog is right next to him, then he grabs the dog by the neck and throws it as hard as he can. The dog yelps in surprise and pain as it hits the ground. Wang gets back in his truck and drives away quickly, before the dog has a chance to recover.
