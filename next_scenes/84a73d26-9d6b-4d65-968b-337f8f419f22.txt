Aleksy is still shaking from the ordeal as he tries to loosen the ropes binding him. His hands are numb and his fingers feel swollen, making it difficult to move. He looks around the store, trying to see if the intruder is still around. He doesn't see anyone, so he starts yelling for help. His voice is hoarse and his throat feels scratchy. He keeps yelling until he hears footsteps running towards the store. The police quickly enter the store and untie Aleksy. He tells them what happened, and they start scouring the store for evidence. Aleksy is asked to go down to the station and give a formal statement. He's still in shock, but he manages to answer the police officer's questions. He's released a few hours later, and he goes home to try and get some sleep.
