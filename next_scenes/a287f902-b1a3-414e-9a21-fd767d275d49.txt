Mashawn wakes up to find himself in a dark, cramped space. He can feel something slimy and slippery all around him, and he tries to move but can't. He's completely immobilized. Then he hears the voice. It's deep and rumbling, like the sound of the creature that attacked him. But it's also strangely familiar, like it's someone he knows. The voice tells him not to be afraid, that he's been chosen. Chosen for what, he doesn't know. But then the voice starts to change, becoming softer and more gentle. It tells him that he's been chosen to be the new host for the creature's offspring. He feels something moving inside him, writhing and squirming. He panics and tries to scream, but it's too late. The creature's offspring has already taken over his body.
