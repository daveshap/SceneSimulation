Aleksy's alarm clock goes off, jolting him awake. He rubs his eyes groggily and sits up, reaching for the alarm to turn it off. He swings his legs over the edge of the bed and stands up, stretching his arms over his head. He yawns and makes his way to the small dresser in the corner of the room, where he selects a pair of clean clothes for the day. He dresses quickly and then heads for the door, pausing to take one last look at his room before leaving.
