Sandy is exhausted from her journey and happy to be home. She takes off her helmet and begins to unpack her supplies. She starts by taking out her sleeping bag and setting it up in the corner of the crater. Next, she takes out her food and water supplies. She is just about to start a fire when she hears a noise outside. Sandy freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. She slowly crawls to the edge of the crater and peeks over. There, she sees a large, furry creature. It is twice the size of a human and has four legs. It is covered in dust and sand, and it is making its way towards the crater. Sandy knows that she is in danger. She quickly grabs her helmet and puts it on. She grabs her backpack and runs towards the creature. She knows that she cannot outrun it, but she has to try. The creature is getting closer and closer. Sandy is about to give up when she sees a large rock ahead of her. She knows that she will not be able to outrun the creature, but she takes a chance and leaps behind the rock. The creature runs past her, and Sandy is safe. She breathes a sigh of relief and climbs out of the crater.
