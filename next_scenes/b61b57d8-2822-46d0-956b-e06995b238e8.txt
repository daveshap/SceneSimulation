The sun is setting, casting a warm glow over the cottage. Mashawn enters, kicking off his boots and hanging up his jacket. He strolls into the living room, where the fire is crackling in the fireplace. He sinks down into his comfortable armchair with a sigh of contentment. This is his favorite time of day, when he can relax and enjoy the quiet of the countryside. He'll have a simple dinner of bread and cheese, and then he'll retire to bed, ready to face another day tomorrow. Mashawn sits for a while, enjoying the peace and quiet, before getting up to start dinner. He slices some bread and cheese, and puts it on a plate. He pours himself a glass of wine, and takes his dinner over to the table. He eats slowly, savoring the flavors of the simple meal. When he's finished, he cleans up his dishes and then heads to bed. He crawls under the covers, and within minutes, he's fast asleep, dreaming of the adventures that tomorrow will bring.
