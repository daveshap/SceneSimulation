Mashawn wakes up with a start. He can hear the sound of his own heartbeat pounding in his ears. It takes him a moment to remember where he is. He's on the moon, in a colony that is still under construction. He's safe, at least for the moment. But he can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. He gets up from his bunk and goes to the window. He looks out at the stars, wondering if anyone is up there looking back at him. He thinks about his family back on Earth. He misses them, but he knows that he's doing important work. He's helping to build a new colony on the moon, and one day his children will be able to live here too. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a noise. He looks around, but he can't see anything. He gets to his feet, heart pounding, and starts to walk back to the safety of the colony. But whatever was making the noise is following him. He quickens his pace, but whatever it is is gaining on him. He turns to run, but before he can take more than a few steps, something grabs him from behind and drags him into the darkness...
