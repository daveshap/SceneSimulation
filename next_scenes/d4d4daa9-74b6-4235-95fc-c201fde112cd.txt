Gabbi is sitting on a bench beneath the Eiffel Tower, keeping an eye on a group of young children who are running and playing all around her. Every so often, one of the children wanders off, and Gabbi has to go and retrieve them. She is also keeping an eye on the time, as she has to return the children to their parents in a few hours. Despite the challenges of her job, Gabbi is enjoying herself. She loves watching the children play and interact with each other. It's always a lot of work, but she knows that it's worth it when she gets to see the children happy and carefree. Suddenly, one of the children comes running up to her, crying and distraught. Gabbi can see that he has a cut on his leg, and she quickly takes him over to the first aid kit to clean and bandage the wound. Once the child is taken care of, Gabbi turns her attention back to the rest of the group, making sure that everyone is safe and accounted for.
