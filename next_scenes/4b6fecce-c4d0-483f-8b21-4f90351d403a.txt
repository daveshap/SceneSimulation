Swathi's heart is racing as she tries to process what just happened. She can't believe she survived; it was truly a miraculous escape. She looks around at the aftermath of the avalanche and sees that her backpack is buried under a pile of snow. She starts to dig it out, her hands shaking from the adrenaline rush. Once she has her backpack, she takes a moment to catch her breath and calm her nerves. She knows she needs to get off the mountain as quickly as possible in case another avalanche happens. Sheraphics her bearings and starts to make her way down the mountain, being careful of any loose snow or debris. She's grateful to be alive and even more grateful to have made it off the mountain safely.
