The elevator starts to descend and she closes her eyes for a moment. When she opens them again, she realizes that the elevator has stopped and the lights are off. She presses the button to try to make it go down again, but nothing happens. She starts to feel a little anxious and starts to bang on the elevator door. After a few minutes, she takes out her phone to call her husband. "Hello? honey, I'm stuck in the elevator. Can you come and get me?" She then hears footsteps approach and someone starts to fiddle with the elevator door. She breathes a sigh of relief as the door opens and her husband steps in. "Come on, let's get you out of here." Her husband leads her out of the elevator and down the hall to the office building exit. They step outside and she takes a deep breath of fresh air. "I thought I was going to be stuck in there all night." Her husband puts his arm around her and they start to walk home. "I'm just glad I was there to get you out. You would have been stuck there for hours if I hadn't come along."
