Aleksy wakes up the next morning, feeling well-rested and refreshed. He gets out of bed and stretches, taking a deep breath and enjoying the peacefulness of his cottage. He walks into the kitchen, where he starts a pot of coffee and begins to prepare breakfast. He hums to himself as he works, feeling happy and content in his home. After breakfast, he cleans up the kitchen and then heads into the living room. He sits down in his chair and picks up a book, starting to read. He reads for a while, stopping occasionally to take a sip of coffee. The morning passes by peacefully, and Aleksy enjoys the quiet time at home.
