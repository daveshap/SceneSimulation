Mashawn continues to draw in the sand, his mind now fully present as he tries to focus on the patterns he's creating. He hears the rabbit rustling in the grass again and wonders if it's coming closer. He's not sure why, but he suddenly feels very uneasy. He stands up and looks around, but doesn't see the rabbit anywhere. He starts to walk towards the trees, thinking that maybe the rabbit went that way. As he gets closer, he hears a branch snap. He freezes and listens, but doesn't hear anything else. He starts to back away slowly, but before he can take more than a few steps, he feels something hit him in the back of the head. He falls to the ground, unconscious.
