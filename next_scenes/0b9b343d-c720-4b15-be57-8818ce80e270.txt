The concert is in full swing, and the crowd is pumped. Swathi is in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by people jumping up and down and bumping into her. She'stotal!y in her element, headbanging away and singing along to the music. She's sweaty and dirty, and she doesn't care. This is the best night of her life. Suddenly, she feels someone grab her from behind. She's about to scream when she realizes it's just her friend. He shouts in her ear over the music, "I've been looking for you everywhere! Come on, let's go get a drink." She nods and follows him out of the mosh pit. As they make their way through the crowd, she can't help but notice how everyone is staring at her. She feels a little self-conscious, but her friend doesn't seem to notice. He's too busy chatting away about the concert. Finally, they make it to the bar and order a couple of drinks. Swathi takes a long sip, letting the cold liquid refreshing her parched throat. She leans against the counter and surveys the room, people-watching. She sees a group of girls laughing and joking together, and she can't help but feel a twinge of jealousy. She's always wished she had a group of friends like that. Suddenly, her friend nudges her and points to the stage. "Look, Swathi, it's your favorite band!" And sure enough, when she looks up, she sees that her favorite band is about to go on stage. She can't believe her luck! She quickly finishes her drink and starts making her way back to the mosh pit. This time, she's not going to let anything stop her from having the time of her life.
