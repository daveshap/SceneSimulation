Aleksy finishes stocking the shelves and heads over to the register to help the customers in line. He is constantly moving, helping customers find what they need and bagging their groceries. He chats with them as he works, getting to know them and making them feel welcome. The store is still busy, but Aleksy is used to the hustle and bustle. He enjoys working here and helping people. The customers are all friendly and he knows most of them by name. He is happy to be able to help them get what they need. After a few hours, the store starts to quiet down and Aleksy is able to take a break. He sits down in the break room with a cup of coffee and opens up his laptop. He checks his email and reads a few news articles. He takes a few minutes to relax before getting back to work. The store is still busy, but not as hectic as it was earlier. He helps a few more customers and then starts to close up for the night. He cleans up the register area and straightens up the shelves. He is the last one to leave the store, making sure everything is in order. He locks the door and heads home for the night.
