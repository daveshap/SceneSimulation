The next morning, Swathi wakes up and gets ready for her day. She doesn't notice the rat in the corner of the room as she goes about her morning routine. She brushes her teeth, washes her face, and gets dressed. She grabs her purse and keys and heads out the door. As she leaves, the rat comes out of its hiding place and begins to explore the room. It sniffing around, looking for food. It doesn't find anything, so it heads back into the corner and hides again. Swathi comes home that evening and the rat is still in the same spot. It watches as she moves around the room, getting ready for bed. She doesn't seem to notice it, so it continues to stay in its hiding spot. The next day, the rat is still in the room when Swathi leaves for work. It spends the day hiding in the corner, coming out only occasionally to explore. It doesn't find anything to eat, so it goes back into hiding. Swathi comes home that night and the rat is still there. She doesn't know what to do, so she just leaves it be and goes to bed. This pattern continues for a few more days. The rat doesn't find anything to eat and it becomes weaker and weaker. Swathi comes home one night and finds the rat lying in the corner, barely alive. It looks up at her with pleading eyes, as if begging for help. Swathi feels bad for the rat, so she decides to call animal control. They come and pick up the rat, and take it to a shelter where it can get the help it needs.
