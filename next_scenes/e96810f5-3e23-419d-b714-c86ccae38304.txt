Bob's vision starts to fade as he hears the sound of laughter coming from the peak. He tries to focus on the figure, but everything starts to go dark. He feels a crushing weight on his chest and he can't breathe. Bob tries to struggle, but it's no use. He feels his body being crushed beneath the weight of the boulder. His last thought is of the peace and quiet of this remote location before everything goes black.
