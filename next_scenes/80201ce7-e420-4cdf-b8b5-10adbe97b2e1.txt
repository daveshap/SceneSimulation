Tom was in shock as he stared at Sarah's lifeless body. He couldn't believe what had happened. He heard a noise behind him and turned to see the killer standing in the doorway. The killer smiled as they raised their bloodied knife. Tom tried to run, but the killer was too quick. They stabbed him in the back and he fell to the ground. The last thing Tom saw was the killer's satisfied smile as they walked away.
