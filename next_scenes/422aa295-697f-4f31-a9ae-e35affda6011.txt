The ambulance arrives within minutes, and Wang steps aside to let the paramedics in. They quickly assess the situation and load the woman onto a stretcher. Wang watches as they hurry her out to the ambulance and load her inside. The doors close and the ambulance speeds away, sirens blaring. Wang is shaken up by the whole ordeal. He's never seen anything like that before. He knows he did the right thing by stepping in and calling for help, but he can't help but feel a little uneasy. He finishes his delivery and heads back to the truck. It's been a long night, and he's ready to go home.
