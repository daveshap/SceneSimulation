Sandy enjoys the quiet of the morning as she walks along the path. The air is still and the only sound is the crunching of her footsteps on the dusty ground. She's walking towards a small hill. From the top of the hill, Sandy knows she'll be able to see the Earth off in the distance. Sandy has been living on the moon for about a year now, and she still can't believe how different everything is. The sights, the sounds, the everyday things are all so different from what she's used to back on Earth. But in a good way. It's like being in a whole new world. As Sandy reaches the top of the hill, she sits down and watches as the sun slowly rises over the Earth. The colors are beautiful, and she can see the different continents and countries. It's a peaceful moment, and Sandy feels lucky to be able to experience it.
