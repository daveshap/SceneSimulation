Tom wakes up to the sound of birds chirping outside the cabin. He stretches and rubs his eyes with his hands. He looks over at Sarah, who is still asleep in the chair. He gets up quietly so as not to wake her, and goes to the window. He looks outside and sees that the sun is already up. He goes over to Sarah and gently shakes her awake. Sarah opens her eyes and looks at Tom. She looks confused for a moment, and then she remembers what happened. She begins to cry, and Tom comforts her. He tells her that they need to get moving, and he helps her to her feet. He gives her a drink of water from his water bottle, and then he Shoulders his backpack. Sarah takes a deep breath and nods her head. She picks up a small backpack that was lying on the ground next to her, and the two of them head out of the cabin. They follow the path through the forest, and after a few hours, they come to a small town. Tom takes Sarah to the police station, and he tells the officer what happened. The officer calls for an ambulance, and Sarah is taken to the hospital. Tom stays with her until she is discharged, and then he takes her home. Sarah's parents thank Tom for his help, and they invite him to stay for dinner. Tom accepts, and he sits down at the table with the family. They all eat and talk together, and Tom feels happy to have been able to help Sarah.
