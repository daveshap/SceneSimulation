Suddenly, the peace is broken by a loud crash. Bob jumps up from his seat, spilling his coffee. He looks out the window and sees a huge crater in the distance, with pieces of debris scattered around it. A cloud of dust is slowly settling over the area. Bob knows he needs to investigate. He grabs his space suit and helmet and heads out the door. He climbs into his lunar rover and drives to the crater. As he gets closer, he can see that it's a ship that crashed. He can also see movement inside the ship. Bob knows he needs to help the people inside. He parks the rover and climbs out. He approach the ship and looks inside. He can see people moving around, trying to free themselves from the wreckage. Bob climbs into the ship to help the people. He starts to pull people out of the wreckage and help them to safety. He knows he needs to hurry. The ship could explode at any moment. After Bob has helped everyone he can, he climbs out of the ship. He looks back at the crater and the debris. He knows he's going to have to tell the other people on the moon what happened. He's going to have to tell them about the crash.
