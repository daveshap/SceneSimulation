Tom is relieved to be back in the village and eagerly makes his way to the nearest tavern. He pushes open the door and is enveloped in the warmth of the room. He can see the fire burning in the fireplace and the people gathered around it, chatting and laughing. He makes his way to the bar and orders a drink. He can feel the tension of the night melting away and he relaxes into his chair.
