The stranger walks away, and Swathi watch him go. She feels a sudden pang of loneliness, even though she was just talking and laughing with him a few moments ago. She looks up at the stars and tries to find the constellations, but she can't see them through the haze of the city lights. She feels a tear run down her cheek, and she wipes it away. She looks back at the waves and watches as they crash against the shore. She feels the sand shift beneath her as she stands up. She dusts off her dress and picks up her book and umbrella. She starts to walk back to her apartment, but she can't help but feel a little disappointed. She had been hoping to find someone to share the beautiful night with, but now she's all alone.
