The young couple walks away hand in hand, and Bob watches them until they disappear into the crowd. He feels happy and grateful that he was able to make their honeymoon even more special. He takes a sip of his coffee and looks around at all the people enjoying the evening. He sees couples holding hands, families playing together, and friends laughing and joking. He feels so lucky to be able to experience all this joy. As the sun sets, Bob thanks God for all the blessings in his life.
