Gabbi enters the kitchen and sets her bag down on the counter. She pulls out her phone and starts to search for a recipe. After a few minutes, she finds one that she likes and starts to gather the ingredients. She chops up some vegetables and puts them in a pot on the stove. She adds some water and then sets the timer for 30 minutes. While the vegetables are cooking, she goes into the living room to check on the baby. The baby is still fast asleep so she goes back into the kitchen to finish making dinner. After the timer goes off, she adds some pasta to the pot of vegetables and stirs it all together. She turns off the stove and goes to set the table. She lays out three plates, some silverware, and some cups. She goes back into the living room and calls the mother into the kitchen. The mother comes in and thanks Gabbi for making dinner. They all sit down and start to eat. Gabbi and the mother chat while they eat, and the baby sleeps peacefully in its crib.
