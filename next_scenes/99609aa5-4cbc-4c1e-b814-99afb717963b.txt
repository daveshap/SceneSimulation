Bob enjoys the view for a few more minutes before heading back inside the coffee shop. He orders a sandwich and a cup of coffee, then takes a seat by the window to continue enjoying the scenery. As he eats, he people-watches and eavesdrops on the conversations going on around him. He hears bits and pieces of several different languages and gets a sense of the friendly, international atmosphere of the place. After finishing his lunch, Bob decided to take a walk around the nearby lake. The path is well-worn and lined with trees, and Bob can feel the crunch of the leaves under his feet as he walks. The air is still and the only sound is the sound of his own footsteps. He comes to a clearing and stops to take in the view. The lake is perfectly still and reflects the surrounding mountains like a mirror. Bob feels a sense of peace and stillness and takes a deep breath before continuing on his walk.
