Bob finishes up his work and stretches his tired muscles. He glances at the clock and sees that it's now 3 AM. He's just about to pack up and go home when he hears a noise outside his office. He freezes, listening intently. It sounds like someone is trying to break into the office next door. Bob quietly grabs his baseball bat and crept towards the door. He peeks out the peephole and sees a man in a ski mask fiddling with the lock. The man looks up and sees Bob watching him. He tries to run away, but Bob is too fast. He catches up to the man and knocks him out with the bat. Bob pulls out his phone and calls the police. He tells them what happened and asks them to send a patrol car to the office. The police arrive a few minutes later and arrest the man. Bob gives them a statement and then goes home for the night.
