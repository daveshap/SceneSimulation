Sandy watches her kids play and enjoys the beautiful sunset. She feels relaxed and happy, sipping on her cocktail. Suddenly, she hears someone yelling. She turns to see a man running towards her, frantically waving his arms. He's yelling about a shark. Sandy's heart skips a beat as she realizes her kids are still in the water. She scream's their names and runs towards them. The man is right behind her, still yelling about the shark. Sandy's kids make it to shore safely and she hugs them tight, thankful that they're okay.
