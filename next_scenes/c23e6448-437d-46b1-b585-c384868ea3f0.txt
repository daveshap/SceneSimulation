Sandy looks around the room for a way to escape, her heart pounding in her chest. She sees a window and runs to it, yanking it open. She scramble onto the fire escape and starts to climb down, her hands shaking. She's almost to the ground when she hears the man pounding on the window, trying to get to her. Sandy screams and jumps the rest of the way to the ground. She starts to run, but she's not sure where to go. She sees a car parked nearby and runs to it, unlock the door and jumps inside. She locks the doors and starts the engine, her hands shaking. She peels out of the parking lot and drives as fast as she can. She's not sure where she's going, but she knows she has to get away from the man. She drives for a few minutes, then sees a police car parked on the side of the road. She pulls over and jumps out of the car, running to the police car. She bangs on the window, screaming for help. The police officer inside wakes up and jumps out of the car, his gun drawn. Sandy is hysterical, and it takes the officer a few minutes to calm her down. When she's finally able to speak, she tells the officer what happened. The officer calls for backup and starts to search the area for the man. Sandy is shaking and terrified, and she's not sure what to do. She wants to go home, but she knows she can't go back to her house. The officer tells her to wait in the car, and she does. She sits in the car, waiting for the officer to return. She's not sure what's going to happen, but she knows she's safe now.
