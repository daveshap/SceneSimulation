Mashawn is so lost in the moment that he doesn't even realize that he's started to float off the ground. He's surrounded by a bright white light, and he can see the outlines of people's faces in the crowd. He looks down and sees that he's floating above the stage. The music is still playing, but it sounds distant and muffled. He sees the people below him, but they look like they're in slow motion. He tries to wave his hands, but they feel heavy and sluggish. He tries to call out, but no words will come out of his mouth. He's floating higher and higher, and the light is getting brighter and brighter. Soon, he can't see anything else. The last thing he hears is the sound of the crowd cheering.
