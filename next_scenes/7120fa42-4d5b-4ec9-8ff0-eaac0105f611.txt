Tom exits his bedroom and enters the living room, where his mother and father are watching television. His mother looks up at him and asks him how his day was. He responds with, "It was good. I'm just glad it's over." His father then asks him if he did his homework. Tom responds with, "Yes, I did it this morning before school." His mother tells him that she is proud of him and his father tells him to have a seat. He then walks over to the couch and sits down. His mother then asks him if he wants something to eat. He responds with, "No, I'm not really hungry." His mother then tells him that she made his favorite food, but he still says that he's not hungry. His father then tells him to just have a little bit. Tom then gets up and goes to the kitchen. He gets a plate of food and sits back down. He then starts to eat and his mother and father start to talk to him about his day.
