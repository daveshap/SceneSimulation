Gabbi is walking to the nearby park with the two young children she babysits. She points out different animals and plants to them as they walk, and the kids are excited and ask lots of questions. After a few hours of playing, the kids are tired and ready to go home. Gabbi takes them by the hand and leads them back to the house. Along the way, they spot a snake sunning itself on a rock. Gabbi carefully points it out to the kids, making sure they don't get too close. When they arrive home, the kids' parents are there to greet them. Gabbi hands the kids off to their parents and says goodbye. She has another job to go to, but she'll be back tomorrow to play with the kids again.
