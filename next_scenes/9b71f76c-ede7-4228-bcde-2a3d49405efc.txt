Wang finishes his lunch and lies back in the grass, taking in the stunning view. He closes his eyes and lets out a contented sigh, enjoying the peacefulness of the moment. Suddenly, he hears the sound of voices carrying on the wind. He sits up and looks towards the mountain trail, seeing a group of hikers making their way up. They look exhausted, and are covered in sweat. Wang waves to them and they wave back. He watches them for a few minutes before they disappear over the top of the mountain.
