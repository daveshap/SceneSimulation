Sandy slowly walks across the surface of the moon, her feet sinking into the powdery surface with each step. She's carrying a large oxygen tank on her back, and her hands are full with a small American flag. She looks up at the Earth, hanging bright and blue in the sky, and feels a surge of pride and patriotism. This is a historic moment: she's the first human being to walk on the moon. Suddenly, she hears a crackling sound in her earpiece. It's Houston, trying to reach her. "Sandy, can you hear me? Come in, Sandy." "Loud and clear, Houston," she says, her voice trembling with excitement. She continues to walk, her eyes on the American flag. She's getting closer and closer to planting it on the surface of the moon. She can see the flagpole in her hand, and the flag rippling in the vacuum of space. She's almost there... Suddenly, her foot hits a rock, and she trips, falling forward. The flagpole goes flying, and the flag comes loose, floating away from her. Sandy watches in horror as the flag floats away, eventually disappearing into the blackness of space. She's failed in her mission. But she knows that this historic moment will be remembered forever, regardless of whether or not the flag is planted on the surface of the moon.
