Tom sits in silence for a moment after Sarah leaves, staring at the spot where she was just standing. He feels numb, like he can't quite process what just happened. He looks over at the whiskey bottle and considers taking another drink, but decides against it. He knows he needs to think clearly if he's going to figure out what to do next. Tom gets up and walks over to the window. He looks out at the street below, watching as Sarah walks away from him. She seems so sure of herself, so certain that this is the right thing to do. But Tom can't help but feel like he's made a huge mistake. He knows he should go after her, try to talk to her and convince her to stay. But he also knows that it's probably too late for that. Tom turns away from the window and starts to pace the room. He runs his hands through his hair, feeling lost and confused. He can't believe this is happening. It all feels like a dream. He stops and sits down on the bed, burying his face in his hands. He doesn't know what to do or where to go from here.
