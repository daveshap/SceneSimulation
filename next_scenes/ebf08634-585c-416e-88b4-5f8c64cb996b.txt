Bob reluctantly gets up from his comfortable chair and walks over to his desk. He sits down and starts sorting through the pile of paperwork. He finds the forms he needs to fill out and starts working on them. He gets through a few of them, but then he gets stuck on one. He reads it over and over again, but he can't make sense of it. He starts to fill it out, but he makes a mistake. He crosses it out and starts over. But he makes another mistake. He throws the pen down in frustration and leans back in his chair. He rubs his eyes and takes a deep breath. He looks at the clock and sees that he's been working on this for an hour. He can't take it anymore. He gets up and walks out of his office.
