Bob makes his way down the mountain, admiring the view as he goes. He can see the valley below, where his coffee shop is located. He can see the people beginning to stir, getting ready for their day. Bob takes a deep breath of the fresh mountain air and feels his muscles relax. It's been a long week and he's looking forward to a day of rest. He's been working hard to get his coffee shop up and running, and it's finally starting to pay off. Bob arrive at his coffee shop and is greeted by his barista, Jim. Jim hands Bob a cup of coffee and Bob takes a sip, smiling in satisfaction. He then heads to the back to start working on some paperwork.
