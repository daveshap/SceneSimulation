Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he cowered in the stockroom, waiting for the intruders to make their way into the store. But instead of the footsteps he was expecting, he heard a strange, ethereal voice. "Aleksy," the voice said. "We've been waiting for you." Aleksy was frozen in place, paralyzed by fear. He didn't know what to do or where to run. The voice seemed to be coming from all around him, surrounding him. And then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a figure materialize in the stockroom. The figure was shrouded in a cloak, its face hidden in the shadows. But Aleksy could feel its eyes on him, piercing through the darkness. "Who are you?" he asked, his voice trembling. "We are the spirits of this store," the figure replied. "We have been trapped here for years, ever since the store closed down. But we knew that one day, someone would come along and free us. And that day is today." Aleksy was still trying to wrap his head around what was happening. He didn't know what to say or do. But the spirits of the store were waiting for him to make a decision. He could either stay and freed them, or he could run away and leave them trapped forever. Aleksy took a deep breath and steeled himself. He knew what he had to do. "I'll stay," he said. "I'll help you." As he took a step forward, the spirits of the store began to dissipate. They were thanking him, thanking him for his courage. And Aleksy knew that he had made the right decision. He was going to help these spirits move on to the next phase of their journey.
