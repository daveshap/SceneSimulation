Sandy stands atop the mountain, watching as the sun slowly rises over the horizon. She feels the fresh air fill her lungs, and the wind blowing through her hair. She feels alive and free, and can't help but smile. As she looks out over the world below her, she sees the trees and the grass, the rivers and the lakes. She sees the animals and the birds, and she can't help but feel a sense of wonder. She gazes at the world around her, and she knows that there is so much to explore. She stays on the mountain top for a while, enjoying the peace and the quiet. But eventually, she knows that she must head back down. After all, there is so much waiting for her in the world below.
