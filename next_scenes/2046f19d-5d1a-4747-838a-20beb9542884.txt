The group continues to dance and sing around the creature, and Wang watches them in awe. He has never seen anything like this before, and he feels privileged to be able to witness it. The group starts to chant, and the creature lifts its head to the sky. Wang sees that its eyes are glowing, and he feels a warm energy emanating from it. The group continues to chant and dance, and Wang feels himself becoming increasingly relaxed. He starts to feel lightheaded, and he realizes that he is in a trance. He hears the group singing, but the words are incomprehensible. He feels himself being drawn into the creature's eyes, and he sees images flashing before him. He sees mountains and forests, rivers and fields, and he sees people dancing and singing around bonfires. He hears laughter and music, and he feels a sense of joy and peace. He feels like he is home. After a while, he comes back to reality and finds that he is lying on the ground. The group is gone, and he is alone with the creature. The sun has set, and the stars are out. Wang feels a deep sense of peace and happiness, and he knows that he has been changed by this experience.
