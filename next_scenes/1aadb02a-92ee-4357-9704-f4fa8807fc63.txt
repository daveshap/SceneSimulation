The room is dark and Mashawn is already asleep. Suddenly, a bright light shines through the window, casting the room in a eerie glow. Mashawn stirs in his sleep but does not wake up. The light grows brighter and brighter until it's almost blinding. Mashawn covers his eyes with his arm, trying to block out the light. A loud rumble echoes through the room and the ground starts to shake. Mashawn wakes up with a start and sits up in bed, wide-eyed with terror. The room is shaking and items are falling off the shelves. The lamp falls off the bedside table and shatters on the floor. Mashawn scramble out of bed and tries to make his way to the door, but he trips and falls to the ground. The shaking gets worse and the room starts to collapse around him. Mashawn screams as he's buried alive beneath the rubble.
