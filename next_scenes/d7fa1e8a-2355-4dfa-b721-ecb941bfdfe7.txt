Tom sits on his bed, looking at the envelope in his hands. He thinks about what it could contain - his mind races with possibilities. After a few minutes, he decides to open it. He carefully slides his finger under the seal and breaks it open. He pulls out a sheet of paper and reads it. His eyes widen in surprise as he realizes what it says. He crumples up the paper and throws it across the room, letting out a frustrated yell. He gets up and pace around the room, trying to calm himself down. After a few minutes, he sits back on the bed and looks at the envelope again. He takes a deep breath and slowly opens it, pulling out the paper once more. He reads it again, his face betraying no emotion. He calmly folds the paper back up and puts it back into the envelope. He stands up and goes to his dresser, retrieving a suitcase from the bottom drawer. He starts packing a few clothes and personal items into the suitcase, not taking his eyes off the envelope the whole time. Once he's finished, he grabs the envelope and the suitcase and leaves the room, not looking back.
