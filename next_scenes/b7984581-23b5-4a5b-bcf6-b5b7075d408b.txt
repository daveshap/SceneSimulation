The woman's screams echo in Wang's mind as he walks down the hall. He can't believe what just happened. He didn't mean to scare her, but he knows he must have looked like a burglar coming into her room. He feels terrible as he replay the scene in his head. He can still see the look of terror on her face. He knows he needs to apologize to her, but he's not sure if he should go back to the room or not. He decides to go back and knock on the door. When the woman opens the door, he can see that she's still shaken up. He apologizes profusely and she eventually accepts his apology. She thanks him for being honest and for not trying to hurt her. They both laugh nervously and Wang is finally able to leave the apartment.
