Jenna wakes up early on her last day on the moon. She feels a mix of excitement and sadness as she prepares to leave her home of the past year. She packs her few belongings and says goodbye to the places and things that have been a part of her life here. She starts at the landing pad, where she first arrived on the moon. She remembers the excitement she felt when she first stepped out of the spaceship and saw the barren, grey landscape stretched out before her. She walks to the airlock and stares out at the stars for a while. She's going to miss the quiet beauty of the night sky. Next, she goes to the greenhouse, where she spent many hours working on her research project. She's going to miss the peaceful atmosphere of this place. Finally, Jenna goes to her bedroom. She stares at her empty bed, remembering all the nights she spent here, reading or looking at pictures of her family and friends back on Earth. She takes one last look around her home on the moon, saying goodbye to the place that has been her home for the past year. Jenna enters the spaceship that will take her back to Earth. She buckles herself in and feels the ship take off. She looks out the window as the moon shrinks in the distance. She feels sad to leave but excited to see her family and friends again. After a few hours, the spaceship enters Earth's atmosphere. Jenna can see the blue planet getting larger and larger as they approach. Finally, the ship lands and Jenna steps out. She's home.
