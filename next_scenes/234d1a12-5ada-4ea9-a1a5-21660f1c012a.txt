The lion looks Jenna in the eyes and seems to understand her fear. It sits down next to her and starts to make a soft, calming noise. Jenna slowly begins to relax and actually starts to pet the lion. She can't believe what's happening but it feels completely natural. The other students have run away screaming, but Jenna feels safe and protected next to the lion. It's an incredible experience that she'll never forget.
