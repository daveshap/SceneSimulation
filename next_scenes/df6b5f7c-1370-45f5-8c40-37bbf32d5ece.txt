Gabbi feels a sense of accomplishment as she steps out of the apartment building. She did it! She successfully babysat the two kids all night, and even managed to have some fun with them. As she walks to the subway, she replays some of the highlights of the night in her head. She remembers reading stories to them and tucking them into bed. She smiles to herself, feeling proud that she was able to handle the situation so well. Suddenly, Gabbi hears a noise coming from the alleyway to her left. She freezes, her heart racing. She told herself she wouldn't be scared, but she can't help it. She slowly backs away from the alley, her eyes darting around the empty street. She's about to turn and run when she sees a rat scurry out from the shadows. She lets out a relieved breath and laughs at herself. She's been in the city for two weeks now and she's still not used to all the noises. Gabbi continues on her way, but she can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her. She quickens her pace, but every time she turns around, there's no one there. She's starting to get freaked out, and she's glad when she finally reaches the safety of the subway station. She hops on the first train that arrives and doesn't relax until she's back in her quiet suburb.
