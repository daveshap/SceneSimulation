The sun continues to set, painting the sky in a beautiful spectrum of colors. Aleksy remains on the porch, lost in thought. He reflect on his life and how content he is. Even though he's been working long hours lately, he can't help but feel grateful for all that he has. The bird from earlier returns, landing on the railing once again. The two of them stare at each other for a moment before the bird takes off again, disappearing into the deepening twilight. Aleksy feels a sense of peace and happiness settle over him. He remains on the porch for a while longer, taking in the beauty of the evening.
