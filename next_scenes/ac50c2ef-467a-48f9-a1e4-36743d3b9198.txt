Wang trudges back to the delivery depot, his stomach growling all the way. He can't help but think about the delicious-looking meal the customer was about to enjoy, and how he himself will have to wait a while longer before he can eat. He eagerly grabs his own lunch from the fridge and sits down to eat, savouring every bite. He can't help but feel a little envious of the customer, but he's just happy to finally have something to eat.
