Aleksy finishes cooking breakfast and sits down at the small table to eat. He looks out the window at the view as he eats, and he's so taken aback by the beauty of it that he almost forgets to eat his food. He eventually snaps out of it and finishes his breakfast, then starts to clean up the hut. He sweeps the floors and dusts the surfaces, then washes the dishes and puts them away. He straightens up the bed and tidies the small living area, then steps outside to take a look around. The sun is higher in the sky now, and the mist has started to clear. He can see for miles in every direction, and the sight takes his breath away.
