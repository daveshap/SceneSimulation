Mashawn steps out of the shower and is hit with a blast of cold air. He shivers as he reaches for a towel to dry off. He looks in the mirror and sees the tired look in his eyes. He knows he needs to get moving if he wants to make it to work on time. He quickly gets dressed and heads for the door. He's about to leave when he remembers he needs to grab something to eat. He opens the refrigerator and looks inside, but there's nothing that looks good to him. He doesn't have time to cook anything, so he'll just have to settle for a sandwich from the gas station. He grabs his keys and wallet and heads out the door.
