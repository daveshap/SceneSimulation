Jenna wakes up slowly, her head throbbing. She can see the creature watching her from the other side of the room and she tries to sit up. She feels disoriented and unsteady. The creature comes over to her and helps her to a sitting position. Jenna looks around and realizes she's inside some kind of spaceship. She has no idea how she got here. The creature speaks to her in a language she doesn't understand, but she feels reassured by its tone. Jenna looks at the creature and slowly stands up. She takes a few steps forward and looks out the window. She can see the moon below them and she gasps. The creature comes to stand next to her and points to the window. Jenna sees that they are orbiting the moon. She looks at the creature and smiles. She knows she's safe now.
