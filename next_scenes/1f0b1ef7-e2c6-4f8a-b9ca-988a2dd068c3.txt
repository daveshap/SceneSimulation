Tom walks down the hall, towards the noise he had heard. He sees a man, dressed in a business suit, walking quickly down the hall carrying a stack of papers. The man doesn't notice Tom and continues walking. Tom watches the man for a moment, then turns and goes back to his desk. He gathers his things and turns off the lights. He walks to the door, unlocks it, and steps out into the night.
