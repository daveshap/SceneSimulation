The chimpanzee drags Bob through the forest, stopping occasionally to hurl him against a tree or bash his head against a rock. Bob is battered and bloody, and he knows he is going to die. The chimpanzee finally stops in a clearing and drops Bob's lifeless body to the ground. It then starts to Forage through Bob's pockets, looking for food. It finds a granola bar and starts to eat it, then notices Bob's phone. It picks up the phone and looks at it for a moment before chucking it into the bushes. The chimpanzee finishes the granola bar and then calmly walks away, leaving Bob's mangled body behind.
