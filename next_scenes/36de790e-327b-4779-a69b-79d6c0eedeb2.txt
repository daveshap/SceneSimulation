Sarah and Bob finish their lunch and Bob offers to do the dishes. Sarah says she will do them later and asks if Bob wants to go for a walk. Bob says that sounds like a great idea and they head out the door. They walk down the street, enjoying the sunny day. They stop to chat with their neighbor, Mrs. Saunders. They talk about the weather and how Mrs. Saunders' garden is doing. They say their goodbyes and continue on down the street. Bob and Sarah window shop and stop to get an ice cream cone. They walk hand in hand, enjoying each other's company. They head home and say goodbye to each other as Sarah goes into her house and Bob goes into his.
