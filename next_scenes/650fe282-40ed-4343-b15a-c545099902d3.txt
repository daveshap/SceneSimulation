Gabbi led the children back to the beach house, keeping a close eye on them as they ran and played. She knew they were hungry, so she decided to make them a quick lunch. She fixed them each a PB&J sandwich and cut up some apples for them to snack on. Timo and Lila sat at the table, munching on their lunch and laughing as they talked. Gabbi sat with them, making sure they ate enough before letting them go back to playing. Once they were finished, the children grabbed their things and ran back outside to play. Gabbi watched them for a while, making sure they were safe, before she went back inside to clean up lunch.
