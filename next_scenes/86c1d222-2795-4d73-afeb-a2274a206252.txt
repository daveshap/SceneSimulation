Jenna enjoys the rest of her day exploring Paris and taking in the sights. She stops to get a crepe from a street vendor and enjoys it as she walks. She people watches some more and takes mental notes of all the different fashion styles she sees. As the sun starts to set, Jenna starts to make her way back to her Airbnb. She's tired from all the walking but is happy that she was able to explore so much of the city. As she's walking, she notices the same man from earlier. He's standing on the side of the street with a homeless woman. He's giving her some money and talking to her. Jenna feels a warmness inside as she sees this act of kindness and she is reminded why she loves to travel so much. It's moments like this that make all the planning and packing worth it.
