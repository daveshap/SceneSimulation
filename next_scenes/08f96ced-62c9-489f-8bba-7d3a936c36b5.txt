Gabbi sat on the beach, watching as the kids played in the sand and splash in the water. It was a beautiful day, and she was enjoying the peace and quiet.Suddenly, she heard a loud cry from one of the kids. She looked over and saw that one of the toddlers had fallen and was now crying. Gabbi rushed over to comfort the child and help him up. She then took him back to his parents, who were sitting nearby. "Thank you so much," the mother said, tears in her eyes. "I was just about to get him when he fell." "It's no problem," Gabbi said, smiling. "Kids fall all the time. He's just lucky he didn't hurt himself." The mother nodded, still looking relieved. Gabbi then went back to her spot on the beach and watched as the kids continued to play.
