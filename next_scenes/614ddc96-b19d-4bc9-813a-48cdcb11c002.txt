The figure comes closer, and Swathi can see that it is a woman wearing a mask. The woman raises her knives and prepares to strike, but Swathi manages to roll away just in time. She scrambled to her feet and started to run, but the woman was right behind her. She felt the sharp pain as the knives sunk into her back and she stumbled. The woman laughed as she watched Swathi fall to the ground. She came closer and prepared to strike again, but Swathi reached out and grabbed her arm. With all her strength, she shoved the woman away and ran in the opposite direction. She could hear the woman's laughter echoing through the forest as she ran, but she didn't stop. She had to get away.
