The next morning, Gabbi wakes up to the sound of the girl stirring in bed. She stretches and rubs her eyes, then looks over at Gabbi. She smiles and says good morning. Gabbi returns the smile and says good morning back. The girl asks if she can get up and Gabbi says yes. She helps the girl out of bed and they go downstairs. The girl says she's hungry and Gabbi says she'll make them breakfast. She heads into the kitchen and starts to rummage through the cupboards, looking for something to make. She finds some eggs and a pan, so she sets to work making scrambled eggs. The girl comes into the kitchen and sits at the table. She watches as Gabbi cooks, then asks if she can help. Gabbi says sure, so the girl gets up and starts to stir the eggs. After a few minutes, the eggs are done and Gabbi puts them on a plate. She sets the plate in front of the girl, who starts to eat. Gabbi asks if she wants anything else and the girl says no, thank you. Gabbi then sits down and eats her own breakfast. When they're done, Gabbi cleans up the kitchen and then asks the girl what she wants to do today. The girl thinks for a moment, then says she wants to go outside and play. Gabbi says that sounds like a great idea. They put on their shoes and coats and head outside. The girl runs to the swings and starts to swing. Gabbi pushing her higher and higher until she's laughing and squealing with delight. They spend the rest of the day outside, playing games and exploring the yard. As the sun starts to set, they go back inside and Gabbi starts to make dinner. She makes the girl's favorite food - spaghetti and meatballs. They eat dinner, then Gabbi cleans up the kitchen. The girl asks if she can take a bath and Gabbi says yes. She runs upstairs and Gabbi starts to run the bathwater. When it's ready, she goes upstairs and helps the girl into the tub. She washes her hair and body, then helps her out of the tub. She dries her off and helps her into her pajamas. The girl gives Gabbi a hug and says goodnight. Gabbi tucks her into bed and kisses her forehead. She then sits in the chair next to the bed and watches as the girl falls asleep.
