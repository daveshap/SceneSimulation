The sun has set by the time Jenna and the guy finish talking on the bench, and he takes her hand as they walk to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The city lights come alive as they watch from above, and Jenna knows she'll remember this night for the rest of her life. The guy looks into her eyes and leans in for a kiss, and she eagerly responds. They spend the night walking around Paris, hand in hand, stopping to kiss every now and then. As the sun starts to come up, they find a spot on the banks of the Seine and watch the sunrise together. They're both exhausted by this point, but they're also both on a high from the night they just shared. They agree to meet up again the following night and say goodbye with a long kiss. Jenna walks away with a spring in her step, feeling like she's just experienced the best night of her life.
