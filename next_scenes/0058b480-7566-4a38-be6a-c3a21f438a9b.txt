Aleksy watches the woman as she walks away. He can't believe he just talked to her. She's so beautiful. He doesn't even know her name. He feels like he's in a dream. He sits down on the sand and stares at the ocean. He's never seen anything so beautiful. He looks back at the woman and she's gone. He feels a little sad that he didn't get to talk to her longer. He's about to take a sandwich out of the picnic basket when he hears someone calling his name. He looks up and see the woman walking back towards him. She's carrying a beach towel and a sunscreen. She smiles at him and asks if he wants to share the beach towel. Aleksy's heart skips a beat again. He's never been this close to a beautiful woman before. He's not sure what to do. The woman sits down next to him and starts talking to him in a foreign language. He can't understand a word she's saying, but he can tell she's being friendly. They chat for a few minutes before the woman stands up and walks away. Aleksy is amazed by what just happened. He can't believe he just had a conversation with a beautiful stranger. He's definitely going to remember this lunchtime beach experience for a long time to come.
