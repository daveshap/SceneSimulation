The sun continues to rise, and Swathi can feel the warmth begin to spread through her body. The waves are still crashing gently against the shore, and the sound is soothing her. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, letting the peace and quiet wash over her. She stays like that for a few minutes, just enjoying the moment. Suddenly, she hears a voice calling her name. She opens her eyes and sees her friend, Rohan, walking towards her. He's grinning and waving, and she can tell he's excited about something. "Hey, Swathi!" he calls out. "I've been looking for you!" "What's up?" she asks, getting to her feet. "I've got some news," he says. "I've been accepted into medical school!" Swathi is thrilled for her friend and they spend the next few minutes chatting and celebrating his good news. The sun is now high in the sky, and the waves are crashing a little harder against the shore. But Swathi doesn't mind. She's surrounded by the peace and beauty of nature, and she feels happy and content.
