Bob finishes his breakfast and puts his dishes in the sink. He grabs his coat and hat off the hook by the door and heads outside. The cold air hits him like a brick wall, and he shivers. He starts walking towards town, his breath billowing out in front of him in a white cloud. The dog follows him, happy to be out and about. The streets are empty at this early hour, and Bob feels like the only person in the world. He walks past the bakery, and the smell of fresh bread makes his stomach grumble. He quickens his pace, eager to get home and warm up by the fire.
