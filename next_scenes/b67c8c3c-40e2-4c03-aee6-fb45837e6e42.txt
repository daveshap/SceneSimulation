Jenna and Sarah said goodbye and Jenna went inside. She was surprised to see her mom home from work early. "Mom, what are you doing home?" she asked. "I need to talk to you," her mom said. "It's about the test." Jenna groaned. She had completely forgotten about the test they were taking tomorrow. "I'm so sorry," she said. "I totally forgot." "It's okay," her mom said. "I've been studying. I can help you." So they spent the next couple of hours studying together. By the time they were done, Jenna felt a lot better about the test. "Thank you so much," she said. "You're welcome," her mom said. "Just remember, we're in this together."
