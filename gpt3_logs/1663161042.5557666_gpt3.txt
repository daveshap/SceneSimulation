The streets are busy with people heading home from work or out to dinner. Gabbi waves to a few familiar faces as she passes by. The park is lit up by the last of the day's sunlight. Gabbi can see Mia sitting on a bench, waiting for her. She quickens her pace, eager to chat with her friend. As she gets closer, she sees that Mia has someone with her. Gabbi slows down, not sure if she should intrude. Mia sees her and calls out, "Gabbi! Come meet my new boyfriend, Luke." Gabbi smiles and approaches the bench. "Nice to meet you, Luke." Luke stands up and shakes Gabbi's hand. "Likewise. Mia has told me so much about you." Gabbi laughs. "I hope she's been saying good things." Mia linked her arm through Luke's. "Of course I have. Gabbi is the best babysitter in the city." Gabbi blushes with pleasure. "Well, I better get going. It was nice meeting you, Luke." "You too, Gabbi. Maybe we'll see you around sometime." Gabbi waves goodbye as she continues on her way. She's happy to see her friend so happy, but she can't help feeling a little jealous. It feels like everyone is moving on with their lives while she's stuck in the same old routine.
