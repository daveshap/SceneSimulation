Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is shining brightly as Swathi enters her cottage in the country. She takes a deep breath of the fresh air and feels a sense of calm wash over her. The rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze is the only sound she can hear. Inside, the cottage is cozy and warm. A fire is crackling in the fireplace and a pot of tea is steeping on the stove. Swathi takes off her shoes and settles down on the couch with a contented sigh. She picks up her laptop and begins to work, but after a few minutes she finds herself daydreaming about the weekend. She's looking forward to taking a long walk in the woods and breathing in the crisp autumn air. Maybe she'll even find a few mushrooms to add to her tea!

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi finishes her work for the day and stretches her arms above her head with a yawn. She stands up and stretches her legs, then goes to the kitchen to start dinner. While she's cooking, she hears the sound of leaves rustling outside. She peers out the window and sees a deer walking through the woods. She watches it for a few minutes, then goes back to cooking. After dinner, she cleans up the kitchen and then settles down on the couch with a cup of tea. She turns on the TV and starts flipping through the channels, but there's nothing on that interests her. She clicks the TV off and sets her cup down on the coffee table. She leans back against the couch and closes her eyes, letting out a long sigh. Suddenly, she hears a loud crash outside. She sits up straight and listens, but there's nothing else. She gets up cautiously and goes to the window, but she doesn't see anything. She stands there for a few minutes, but there's no other sound. She shrugs and goes back to the couch, turning on the TV again.
