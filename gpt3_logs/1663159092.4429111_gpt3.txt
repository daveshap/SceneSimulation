SCENE: Aleksy is a grocery store clerk who is currently taking a smoke break under the Eiffel Tower. It is dusk, and the tower is illuminated with bright lights. Aleksy is enjoying the view and admiring the architecture when he suddenly hears a loud noise. He looks up to see a large object falling from the top of the tower. He realizes it is a person and starts to run, but it is too late. The person hits the ground with a thud, narrowly missing Aleksy. He is horrified and starts to tremble. He looks around to see if anyone else saw what happened, but no one is around. He decides to go back to the grocery store and pretend like nothing happened.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy slowly makes his way back to the grocery store, his mind racing with what he just witnessed. He is in shock and has trouble processing what he saw. He tries to act casual as he enters the store, but his trembling hands give him away. His boss asks him what is wrong, but Aleksy insists that he is fine. He is adamant about not going to the police, as he does not want to be involved. His boss sends him home for the night, and Aleksy is relieved. He knows he will not be able to forget what he saw, but he hopes that time will help ease the trauma.
