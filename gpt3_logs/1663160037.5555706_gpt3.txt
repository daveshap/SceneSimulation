Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn climbs up the last few feet of the mountain, his heart pounding in his chest. He's finally made it to the top. As he looks around, he takes in the breathtaking view of the valley below, the setting sun bathing everything in a warm, golden light. A smile spreads across his face as he realizes that he's finally made it to his goal. He looks down at his hands, calloused and rough from years of hard work. It's all been worth it, he thinks to himself, to be able to experience this moment. He takes a deep breath and looks around one last time before starting the trek back down the mountain.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn climbs down the mountain, his heart still pounding in his chest. He takes each step carefully, making sure not to slip on the loose rocks. He knows it won't be long before the sun sets and the temperature starts to drop, so he wants to make it down as quickly as possible. He finally reaches the bottom and lets out a sigh of relief. He's tired, but he's happy to have made it down safely. He looks up at the mountain one last time before making his way back to camp.
