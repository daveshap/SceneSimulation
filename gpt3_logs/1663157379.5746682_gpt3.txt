Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting behind the mountains, casting a beautiful orange glow over the snow-capped peaks. Gabbi is sitting on a bench, bundled up in a warm coat and scarf, watching the stars come out one by one. She's been babysitting the kids all evening, and they're finally asleep. It's been a long day, but Gabbi is happy to just sit here and enjoy the quiet.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun finally dips below the horizon, and the stars come out in full force. Gabbi can see the Milky Way stretching out overhead. She feels a sense of peace settle over her as she sits there, surrounded by the beauty of nature. The only sound is the gentle crunch of snow as she shifts on the bench. Suddenly, she hears a noise off in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. Gabbi gets up from the bench and starts walking towards the sound. She knows she shouldn't go poking around in the dark, but she can't just ignore someone who is obviously in distress. As she gets closer, she starts to make out the figure of a person huddled on the ground. It's a young woman, and she's sobbing uncontrollably. Gabbi approaches cautiously, not wanting to startle her. "Hey, are you okay?" she asks softly. The woman looks up at her with red-rimmed eyes. "No, I'm not okay," she says, her voice shaking. "My boyfriend just broke up with me, and I don't know what to do." Gabbi sits down next to her and puts an arm around her shoulders. "It's going to be okay," she says comfortingly. "You're going to get through this." The woman continues to cry for a few minutes, but eventually she calms down. Gabbi stays with her until she's sure she's okay, and then she heads back to the bench. She sits there for a while, looking up at the stars, before she finally gets up and goes back inside.
