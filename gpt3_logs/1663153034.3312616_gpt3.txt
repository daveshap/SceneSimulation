Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Jenna is on the moon, standing on the surface near the edge of a crater. She looks up at the sky, which is beginning to turn a deep blue. The stars are just starting to come out, and Jenna can see the Earth in the distance, a bright blue and white sphere hanging in the sky. Jenna is wearing a spacesuit, but she has removed her helmet and is breathing the air of the moon. She feels a sense of exhilaration being on the surface of the moon, and she can't help but to smile. Suddenly, Jenna hears a noise behind her and she turns around to see a large, dark object rising up out of the crater. Jenna's heart starts to race as she realizes that she is not alone on the moon.
