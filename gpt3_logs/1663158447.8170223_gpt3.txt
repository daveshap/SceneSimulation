SCENE: Aleksy had just gotten home from his shift at the grocery store and was famished. He went to the fridge and grabbed a left over sandwich from the day before and headed to his bedroom to eat. He turned on the TV and sat down on his bed to eat and watch his favorite soap opera. He was half way through his sandwich when he started to feel drowsy. He turned off the TV and laid down, sandwich in hand, and promptly fell asleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy was in the middle of a dream where he was winning the lottery and buying a yacht when he was jolted awake by a loud crash. He sat up in bed and realized that the noise had come from his living room. He got out of bed and grabbed a knife from his kitchen on the way to the living room. When he got there he saw that the window was broken and there was a brick on the floor. He cautiously approached the window and looked out, but didn't see anyone. He went to the door and looked out the peephole, but again, didn't see anyone. He went back to his bedroom and grabbed his phone to call the police.
