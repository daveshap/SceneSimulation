SCENE: Jenna wakes up in the middle of the night, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear strange noises coming from outside her bedroom window. cautiously, she gets out of bed and creeps to the window, peeking out through the curtains. She can see shadowy figures moving around in the backyard and her blood runs cold. She knows she should call the police, but she's too scared to move. She stands there frozen, heart racing, until the figures finally disappear into the night. Jenna is relieved, but shaken. She quietly goes back to bed and tries to go back to sleep, but her mind is racing and she can't seem to shake the feeling that someone is watching her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna cannot shake the feeling that she is being watched. She spends the rest of the night awake, heart racing, eyes darting around the room. Every sound makes her jump. She is too scared to leave her bed, too scared to turn on the lights. She feels like she is trapped in a nightmare. The hours drag on and Jenna starts to feel exhausted. Her eyes start to droop and eventually she falls into a fitful sleep. She is jolted awake by a loud crash. She sits up in bed, heart pounding, and listens. She can hear footsteps outside her bedroom door. Someone is in her house. She is about to scream when the door bursts open and a figure comes into the room. Jenna is paralyzed with fear. She cannot move, cannot speak. The figure comes closer and she can see that it is a man. He is wearing a ski mask and brandishing a knife. Jenna tries to scream, but no sound comes out. The man comes closer and closer until he is standing over her bed. Jenna closes her eyes, waiting for the inevitable, but nothing happens. She hears the man turn and walk out of the room. She waits a few minutes, heart racing, before getting out of bed. She carefully makes her way to the door, listening for any sign of the intruder. She doesn't hear anything so she cautiously steps into the hallway. She can see that the front door is open and she knows that the man is gone. She quickly runs to the door and slams it shut, locking all the locks. She leans against the door, shaking. She is safe. But she knows that she will never forget what happened tonight.
