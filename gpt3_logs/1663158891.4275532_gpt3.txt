Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna wakes up slowly, the early morning light filtering in through her bedroom window. She rubs her eyes and stretches, then swings her legs out of bed and stands up. She stretches again, yawning, then goes over to her dresser and begins to get dressed for the day. She puts on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, then goes over to her mirror to brush her hair. She ties it back into a ponytail, then goes over to her bedroom door and opens it, stepping out into the hallway.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna walks down the hallway, her footsteps echoing in the silence. She goes down the stairs and into the kitchen, where she finds her mother already up and making breakfast. Jenna greets her mother and sits down at the table, where her mother puts a plate of pancakes in front of her. Jenna begins to eat, and after a few minutes, her mother asks her how she slept. Jenna says she slept well and thanks her mother for the pancakes. Her mother tells her it's no problem and that she should get going soon if she wants to make it to school on time. Jenna finishes her breakfast, then puts her plate in the sink and goes to grab her backpack. She gives her mother a hug and a kiss on the cheek, then heads out the door and down the street to school.
