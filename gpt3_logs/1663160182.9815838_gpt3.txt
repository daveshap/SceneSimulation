Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It was getting dark, and Bob knew he had to find someplace to camp for the night. He had been walking through the forest for hours, and he was getting tired. He saw a light up ahead, and he walked towards it. When he got closer, he saw that it was a campfire. There were people around the fire, and they were speaking a language that Bob didn't understand. He didn't want to intrude, so he started to walk away. One of the people saw him and called out to him in English. Bob walked over to the fire and introduced himself. The people were friendly, and they offered him some food and a place to sleep for the night. Bob was grateful, and he accepted their offer. He sat down by the fire and ate the food they gave him. Then he lay down and went to sleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob awoke to the sound of voices around the campfire. He opened his eyes and saw that the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, trying to wake himself up. The people around the fire were speaking in their native language, and Bob couldn't understand a word they were saying. He got to his feet and stretched, then walked over to the fire. One of the people saw him and greeted him in English. Bob smiled and nodded, then sat down by the fire. He accepted a cup of coffee from one of the people and sipped it, savoring the rich flavor. The people were friendly, and Bob felt at ease in their company. He chatted with them for a while, then bid them farewell and set off on his journey again.
