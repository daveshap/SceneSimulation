Swathi sits at her desk, hunched over her computer screen, her fingers flying across the keyboard. She's in the middle of a programming project and she's determined to finish it before she goes home for the night. Outside, the city bustles with activity. Cars honk and horns blare. The sound of footsteps echo through the hallway as people hurry to finish up their workday. But in Swathi's office, all is calm and quiet. She leans back in her chair, stretching her tired muscles. She's been working on this project for days and she's starting to feel the strain. But she knows she's getting close to the finish line. Suddenly, the door to her office swings open and her boss walks in. He looks angry and he's carrying a stack of papers. "Swathi, I need you to take a look at this," he says, thrusting the papers into her hands. She looks at him, confused. "What is it?" she asks. "It's the reports from the beta test of the software you've been working on," he replies. "There are a lot of issues that need to be fixed before we can release it to the public." Swathi's heart sinks. She had been so close to finishing her project. Now she's going to have to go back and make a lot of changes. But she knows that's just part of the job. She takes the papers from her boss and gets to work.
