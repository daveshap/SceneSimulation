SCENE: Swathi had always wanted to visit the Eifel Tower. She had seen pictures of it online and in movies, and it looked like the most beautiful and romantic place in the world. So when she found out she was going to be in Paris for work, she made sure to schedule some time to go see it. Now, she was standing underneath it, gazing up at its towering glory. The night was cool and clear, and the stars shone bright overhead. Swathi felt a sense of wonder and awe as she looked at the magnificent structure. Suddenly, she heard a noise behind her. She turned around, but there was no one there. She scanned the area, but there was still no one to be seen. Then she heard the noise again, and this time it sounded like footsteps. Swathi's heart began to race as she realized someone was following her. She started to walk quickly, but the footsteps got faster too. Then she began to run, but the footsteps were right behind her. She was about to scream when she felt a hand clamp over her mouth.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

Swathi was paralyzed with fear as she felt the hand over her mouth. She tried to scream, but no sound came out. She could feel the person's hot breath on her neck, and she knew she was in trouble. She started to struggle, but the person was too strong. Then she felt something cold and sharp pressed against her throat. "Don't make a sound," the person whispered. "If you do, I'll kill you." Swathi's whole body was shaking, and she was sure she was going to die. Then the person started to drag her away, and she knew she was in for a long night.
