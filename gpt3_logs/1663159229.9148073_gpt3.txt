SCENE: Wang had been driving for hours, and was finally nearing the end of his shift. He was looking forward to getting home and getting some rest. As he pulled up to the address he'd been given, he frowned. It was clearly a residential area, and it was late at night. He was about to turn around and head back to the depot when he noticed a light on in one of the houses. He realized that this must be the right place after all. He pulled up to the house and got out of his car. He could see the light coming from a window on the second floor. He approached the house and knocked on the door. After a moment, a woman answered the door. She looked tired and worried. "I have a delivery for you," Wang said. The woman took the package from him. "Thank you," she said. "I'm sorry for the trouble." Wang shrugged. "It's no trouble. I'm just glad I could help." The woman thanked him again and then closed the door. Wang got back into his car and drove away.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang pulled up to the address and got out of his car. He could see the light coming from a window on the second floor. He approached the house and knocked on the door. After a moment, a woman answered the door. She looked tired and worried. "I have a delivery for you," Wang said. The woman took the package from him. "Thank you," she said. "I'm sorry for the trouble." Wang shrugged. "It's no trouble. I'm just glad I could help." The woman thanked him again and then closed the door. Wang got back into his car and drove away. As he drove away, Wang began to feel uneasy. He had a bad feeling about the woman he had just delivered the package to. He didn't know what it was, but he knew he had to go back. He turned around and headed back to the house. When he arrived, he could see that the light was still on in the second floor window. He approached the house and knocked on the door. There was no answer. He knocked again, louder this time. Still no answer. He tried the handle, and the door was unlocked. He slowly pushed it open and called out, "Hello? Is everything okay?" There was no answer. Wang began to feel scared. He didn't know what he would find inside. He took a deep breath and walked in. The house was eerily silent. Wang could hear his own heart beating. He slowly made his way up the stairs to the second floor. The light was coming from a room at the end of the hall. Wang slowly approached the room, his heart pounding in his chest. He peeked inside. The woman he had delivered the package to was lying on the floor, motionless. Wang gasped and ran to her. He turned her over and saw that she was dead. There was a large gash in her head. Wang's hands were trembling. He didn't know what to do. He slowly stood up and backed out of the room. He had to get out of there. He ran down the stairs and out of the house. He got into his car and drove away, his hands shaking the whole time.
