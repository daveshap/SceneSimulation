SCENE: Gabbi is sitting at her desk in the office, surrounded by piles of papers. She looks up as the door opens and a woman walks in. The woman is holding a baby. Gabbi smiles and gets up from her desk. "Hello, Mrs. Saunders. How are you today?" "I'm fine, thank you," Mrs. Saunders replies. "I'm just here to drop off my son, Joshua. His babysitter cancelled on me last minute, so I was wondering if you could watch him for a couple of hours." "Of course," Gabbi says. "I would be happy to." She takes Joshua from Mrs. Saunders and settles him in a nearby playpen. Joshua starts to cry, but Gabbi quickly picks him up and starts to rock him. "There, there," she murmurs. "It's okay. Gabbi's here." Soon, Joshua is calm and happy, playing contentedly with his toys. Gabbi watches him with a smile on her face, her heart warming at the sight of the happy little boy.

Gabbi continues to rock Joshua in her arms, gently swaying back and forth as he gazes up at her with his big brown eyes. She smiles down at him, brushing his soft hair back from his forehead. Suddenly, the door to the office opens and a frazzled-looking woman walks in. "I'm sorry, I'm looking for Gabbi Wilson," she says, eyeing Joshua warily. "I'm Gabbi," Gabbi says, setting Joshua down in his playpen and getting to her feet. "Is everything okay?" "No, everything is most definitely not okay," the woman says, her voice trembling. "My daughter, Emily, she's missing. I was wondering if you've seen her?"
