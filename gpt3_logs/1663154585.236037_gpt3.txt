Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The night is warm and humid, and the sounds of insects fill the air. A lone light fixture illuminates the dusty bar, where Tom is wiping glasses. He's a thin man with tired eyes, and he moves slowly as he works. The door opens, and a woman walks in. She's wearing a bright dress, and her hair is pulled back in a tight bun. She looks around the bar, and when she sees Tom, she walks over to him. "Hello," she says. "I'm looking for someone." Tom nods and points to a man sitting at a table in the corner. The woman thanks him and walks over to the man. They exchange a few words, and then the woman sits down. The man looks up at Tom and nods, and Tom comes over with a bottle of whiskey. He pours a glass for the man, and then goes back to wiping glasses. The woman and the man talk for a while, and then the man gets up to leave. He drops some money on the table, and the woman stands up. They exchange a few more words, and then the man walks out the door. The woman stays for a few more minutes, finishing her drink. Tom watches her as she sits there, lost in thought. Then she gets up and leaves, without saying a word.
