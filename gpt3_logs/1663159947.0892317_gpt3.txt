SCENE: It's a quiet evening, and Wang is making his usual rounds delivering packages to the rural country cottage. He's been making this same route for years, and knows all the residents by name. They all seem to be good, honestfolk, just trying to make an honest living. As he approaches the cottage, he sees a light on in the window and knows that someone is home. He delivers the package to the door and is about to head back to his truck when he hears a loud crash from inside the cottage. Wang hesitates for a moment, unsure of what to do. He doesn't want to get involved, but he can't just leave if there's something wrong. He decides to knock on the door and see if everything is alright. When there's no answer, he tries the door handle and finds that it's unlocked. He slowly enters the cottage, calling out the resident's name. When there's no response, he begins to worry that something bad has happened. He cautiously makes his way through the cottage, checking each room for the resident. He finally finds them in the kitchen, lying on the floor unconscious. Wang immediately rushes to their side and Checks for a pulse. When he finds one, he lets out a sigh of relief. He knows he needs to get help, and fast. He grabs a nearby phone and dials 911, requesting an ambulance. He stays on the line with the operator until help arrives, and then he gives a statement to the police. Wang is thankful that he was able to help, and is glad that the resident is going to be okay.
