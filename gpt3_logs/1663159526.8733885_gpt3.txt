SCENE: Aleksy, a grocery store clerk, was on his lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. Mid-afternoon, the sun was shining and the breeze was blowing. Aleksy was enjoying the view when he heard a noise. He looked over and saw a rock slide coming down the mountain. He had just enough time to get out of the way before the rocks came tumbling down.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The rock slide came crashing down the mountain, narrowly missing Aleksy. He stood there for a moment, heart pounding, before realizing that he needed to get out of there. He started to run down the mountain, but it was difficult going. The loose rocks made it hard to keep his footing, and he was quickly winded. He looked over his shoulder and saw the rock slide coming down after him. He was moving as fast as he could, but he knew he wasn't going to make it. Just as the rock slide was about to overtake him, Aleksy leapt to the side and barely escaped being crushed. He lay there for a moment, shaking with relief, before getting up and continue his descent.
