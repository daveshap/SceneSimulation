Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a cold, dark night on the moon. Tom is bartending at the only bar in town, The Lunar Lounge. It's a quiet night, with only a few customers. Tom is wiping down the bar, when he sees a familiar face walk in. It's Jack, a regular at the bar. "Hey, Jack. What can I get you tonight?" "Just a whiskey, Tom. neat." Tom pours a glass of whiskey for Jack and slides it across the bar. "You look like you've seen a ghost, Jack. What's up?" "I just saw something out on the plains. Something...unnatural." "What do you mean?" "I don't know. I can't explain it. But it was definitely something not of this world." Tom leans in, interested in what Jack has to say. "What did it look like?" "I don't know. It was dark, and I couldn't see it clearly. But it was big. And it was moving fast." "Did it see you?" "I don't know. I don't think so. I'm not sure." "What did you do?" "I turned and ran the other way. I didn't want to stick around to find out what it was." Tom nods his head, understanding. "I don't blame you, Jack. But whatever it was, it's not your fault. These things happen." "I know. But I can't help but feel like it's my fault. Like I shouldn't have been there." "Don't blame yourself, Jack. There's nothing you could have done." Tom pours Jack another drink, and the two men sit in silence, contemplating what Jack saw.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jack takes a long sip of his drink, then looks up at Tom with a solemn expression. "I can't shake the feeling that whatever I saw out there is going to come back," he says. "I'm not sure what it is, but I know it's not natural. And it's definitely not from around here." Tom nods his head, understanding Jack's fears. "I've seen things like that before, Jack. Not on the moon, but on other planets. There are some things in the universe that are just beyond our understanding. But that doesn't mean we should be afraid of them." "I know. But it's hard not to be when you don't know what it is you're up against." "Trust me, Jack. I know what it's like to be afraid of the unknown. But the best thing you can do is face your fears head on. Only then will you be able to understand what it is you're up against." Jack nods his head, understanding what Tom is saying. He takes another sip of his drink, then stands up to leave. "I think I'm going to head home now, Tom. Thanks for the drink." "No problem, Jack. I'll see you soon." Tom watches as Jack leaves the bar, then goes back to wiping down the counter. He can't help but wonder what Jack saw out on the plains. Whatever it was, it definitely wasn't from around here.
