Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is a construction worker who is working on the construction of the Eiffel Tower. He is currently working on the second level of the tower, which is about half way up. He is working on the construction of the frame for the level, and is using a welding machine to weld the metal bars together. The welder is turned on and is producing a bright light and a lot of noise. Mashawn is wearing a welder's mask and is holding the welding torch in his hand. He is wearing a construction workers hard hat, and is wearing a safety harness that is attached to the frame of the tower. He is welding the metal bars together, and is taking a break to drink some water. He is sweating profusely, and is wiping his brow with his sleeve. He is wearing dirty overalls, and his hands are covered in soot. He takes a drink of water from his bottle, and then goes back to welding the metal bars together.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Amid the sound of the welding machine and the burning metal, Shawn's.* head snaps up at the screech of metal against metal. Alarmed, he looks around to see what's happening. He sees one of the metal bars he just welded starting to buckle under the weight of the construction materials it's supposed to be holding. Shawn quickly grabs his safety harness and hooks it onto the frame of the tower to keep himself from falling.He reaches for his welding torch and starts working on the metal bar, trying to weld it back into place. His hands are shaking from the adrenaline, and he's just about to put the torch down and take a break when he hears someone shouting from below. He looks down and sees one of the other construction workers gesturing wildly and yelling for him to come down. Shawn shakes his head and points at the metal bar he's working on. The other worker nods and runs to get help. Shawn goes back to work, welding the metal bar back into place. He's relieved when it holds, and he takes a moment to catch his breath before starting to weld the next one.
