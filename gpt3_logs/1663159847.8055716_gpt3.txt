Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting in the sky, casting a red glow over the dense forest. Swathi is walking along a narrow path, her feet sinking into the soft, spongy earth beneath her. She is sweating profusely, and her heart is pounding in her chest. She knows she is being followed, and she is terrified. Suddenly, she hears a twig snap behind her. She whirls around, her heart in her throat. There is nothing there. She stands there for a moment, panting, before continuing on her way. She comes to a clearing and breathes a sigh of relief. But her relief is short-lived, as she hears something moving in the bushes. She freezes, her heart pounding. Suddenly, a figure springs out from the bushes and grabs her. She screams, as she is dragged away into the darkness...

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The figure drags Swathi into the bushes, her screams echoing through the air. She struggles against her captor, but it is no use. He is too strong. He covers her mouth with his hand to muffle her screams and wraps his other arm around her waist, restraining her. She continues to struggle, but eventually she tires and goes limp in his arms. He drags her further into the bushes, away from the path. He lays her down on the ground and ties her hands and feet with rope, making sure she is securely bound. Then he gags her with a piece of cloth, to prevent her from screaming. He looks at her scared, helpless face and feels a twinge of guilt, but he pushes it aside. He has a job to do. He stands up and walks away, leaving her alone in the darkness.
