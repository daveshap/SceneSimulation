Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The concert is in full swing, with the band playing their hearts out on stage. Swathi is in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by other headbanging fans. She's letting the music wash over her, feeling the bass vibrate through her body. She's lost in the moment, dancing and singing along with the rest of the crowd. The band is playing an epic riff and the mosh pit is going wild. Swathi is jumping up and down, her hair flying around her face. She's laughing and cheering along with the rest of the crowd. The energy in the air is electric. The song comes to an end and the crowd erupts into applause. Swathi is sweaty and out of breath, but she's grinning from ear to ear. She's had an incredible time, and she knows she'll be coming back for more.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The band finishes their set and leaves the stage to huge applause. Swathi makes her way out of the mosh pit, her body still buzzing with energy. She's sweaty and her hair is a mess, but she doesn't care. She's had the time of her life. She grabs a water bottle from a nearby vendor and downs it, then heads to the merch table to buy a shirt. She's chatting with the band's merch guy when she sees someone she knows. Sheexcitedly waves them over. It's her friend Sarah, who she went to the concert with. They chat for a few minutes about how amazing the show was, then head out to the parking lot. They're both exhausted from the night's events, but they can't stop smiling. They say their goodbyes and head to their separate cars. Swathi is already looking forward to the next show.
