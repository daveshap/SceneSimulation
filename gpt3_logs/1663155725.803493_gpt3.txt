Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun is beating down on the concertgoers as they sway to the music. Sandy is standing in the middle of the crowd, her eyes closed and her arms raised above her head. She's lost in the music, dancing and singing along with the rest of the crowd. She's wearing a flowy dress and her hair is pulled back in a messy bun. She looks like she's having the time of her life.
