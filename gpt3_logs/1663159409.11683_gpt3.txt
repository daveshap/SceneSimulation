Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob is standing on a mountaintop in Europe, surrounded by snow-capped peaks. It's lunch time, and he's enjoying the view from his coffee shop. He can see for miles in every direction, and the air is crisp and clean. He's surrounded by the sound of birds chirping and the wind blowing through the trees. He takes a deep breath and feels alive.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob enjoys the view for a few more minutes before heading back inside the coffee shop. He orders a sandwich and a cup of coffee, then takes a seat by the window to continue enjoying the scenery. As he eats, he people-watches and eavesdrops on the conversations going on around him. He hears bits and pieces of several different languages and gets a sense of the friendly, international atmosphere of the place. After finishing his lunch, Bob decided to take a walk around the nearby lake. The path is well-worn and lined with trees, and Bob can feel the crunch of the leaves under his feet as he walks. The air is still and the only sound is the sound of his own footsteps. He comes to a clearing and stops to take in the view. The lake is perfectly still and reflects the surrounding mountains like a mirror. Bob feels a sense of peace and stillness and takes a deep breath before continuing on his walk.
