Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sky is dark and filled with stars. Aleksy is standing on the surface of the moon, next to a small grocery store. It's 6pm, and the store is about to close. Aleksy is wearing a spacesuit and carrying a backpack full of groceries. He walks into the store and is greeted by the clerk, who is also wearing a spacesuit. Aleksy begins to browse the shelves, looking for something to eat. He eventually settles on a package of crackers and a bottle of water. He takes his groceries to the counter and pays for them. The clerk hands him his change and Aleksy gives her a friendly smile. He thanks her for her help and then heads back out into the lunar night.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy walks out of the store and is hit with a gust of cold air. He shivers and pulls his coat closer to his body. He begins to walk towards his home, which is a small dome located a few miles away. He knows he won't make it there before dark, so he decides to set up camp for the night. He finds a spot near a small crater and starts to unpack his backpack. He pulls out a small tent and sets it up. He crawls inside and zips up the entrance. He takes off his helmet and gloves and begins to eat his crackers. He stares up at the stars and wonders what life is like on Earth. He eventually falls asleep and dreams of home.
