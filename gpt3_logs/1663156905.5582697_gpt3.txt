Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is in the middle of a huge concert, surrounded by throngs of people. He's sweating profusely, and his heart is pounding in his chest. The music is deafening, and the lights are so bright that they're almost blinding. He's never felt so alive before. He's jumping up and down, waving his hands in the air, and singing at the top of his lungs. He's completely lost in the moment, and he doesn't care about anything else in the world.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn is so lost in the moment that he doesn't even realize that he's started to float off the ground. He's surrounded by a bright white light, and he can see the outlines of people's faces in the crowd. He looks down and sees that he's floating above the stage. The music is still playing, but it sounds distant and muffled. He sees the people below him, but they look like they're in slow motion. He tries to wave his hands, but they feel heavy and sluggish. He tries to call out, but no words will come out of his mouth. He's floating higher and higher, and the light is getting brighter and brighter. Soon, he can't see anything else. The last thing he hears is the sound of the crowd cheering.
