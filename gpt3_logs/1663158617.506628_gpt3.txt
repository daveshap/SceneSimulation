SCENE: Sandy is lounging on the lunar surface, enjoying the quiet of the evening. She's been looking forward to this all day - her husband is working the night shift and the kids are finally in bed. It's nice to have some time to herself. She gazes up at the stars, marveling at the way they seem so much brighter here on the moon. She remembers the first time she saw them, on her honeymoon. It feels like a lifetime ago. She's glad they decided to move out here - it's been good for the whole family. Suddenly, she hears a noise. It sounds like someone is coming. She gets up and dusts herself off, heart racing. She knows she shouldn't be out here by herself - it's against the rules. But she can't help but be curious. She peers around a nearby crater and sees a man walking towards her. He's wearing a spacesuit and carrying a rifle. Sandy swallows hard, not sure what to do. She's about to call out to him when he raises the rifle and points it at her. Sandy freezes, terror gripping her. She knows she's in trouble now. The man starts to speak, but his words are garbled. Sandy can't understand what he's saying. He takes a step closer and she backs away. Suddenly, he opens fire. Sandy screams as she feels the bullets tearing into her. She collapses to the ground, dead. The man walks away, leaving her body behind.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The man walks away from Sandy's lifeless body, heart heavy with sadness. He knows he shouldn't have kill her, but she left him no choice. He had been stranded on the moon for weeks, slowly losing his mind. When he saw her walk out into the lunar surface, he thought she was a mirage. But as she got closer, he realized she was real. He was so happy to see another human being, he didn't think about the consequences. When she saw him and started to back away, he panicked and opened fire. Now he regrets it, but it's too late to take it back. He knows he won't be able to go back to Earth now - he's a murderer. He'll have to find some way to make peace with what he's done and live out the rest of his days alone on the moon.
