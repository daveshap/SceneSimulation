He quickly finishes up his chores and locks the door, turning off the lights as he goes. Bob hurries home, eager to get back to his family. He knows they'll be waiting for him, and he doesn't want to keep them up too late. As he walks through the empty streets, he can't help but feel a sense of loneliness.

He knows that as long as he has them, he'll be alright.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob hurried home, eager to get back to his family. He knew they would be waiting for him and he didn't want to keep them up too late. He walked through the empty streets, feeling a sense of loneliness. He was one of the only people left on the moon and it was a feeling he was getting used to. But Bob knew that he was lucky. He had a home and a family to go back to and he was grateful for that. He knew that as long as he had them, he would be alright. When he got home, his family was indeed waiting for him. His wife and two young children were sitting at the kitchen table, and they all immediately rose to greet him. His wife gave him a kiss on the cheek and his children hugged him around the waist. They were all happy to see him, and Bob was happy to be home. After he'd settled down and had a chance to talk with his family, Bob went to bed. But even though he was tired, he found that he couldn't sleep. He couldn't stop thinking about the moon and how lonely it was. He wondered if there were other people out there, people who were also lonely and looking for a place to call home. Bob knew that he was lucky to have found his home on the moon, and he vowed to never take it for granted.
