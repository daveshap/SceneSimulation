Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Swathi is a software engineer who works in an office building. It is 6pm and she is still working on her computer. She is very tired and her eyes are starting to hurt. She rubs her eyes and then gets up to stretch her legs. She leaves her office and walks down the hall to the elevators. She presses the button to go down to the lobby and then gets in. The elevator starts to descend and she closes her eyes for a moment. When she opens them again, she realizes that the elevator has stopped and the lights are off. She presses the button to try to make it go down again, but nothing happens. She starts to feel a little anxious and starts to bang on the elevator door. After a few minutes, she takes out her phone to call her husband. "Hello? honey, I'm stuck in the elevator. Can you come and get me?" She then hears footsteps approach and someone starts to fiddle with the elevator door. She breathes a sigh of relief as the door opens and her husband steps in. "Come on, let's get you out of here."
