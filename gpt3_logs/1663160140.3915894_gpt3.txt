Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's the middle of the night, and Sandy is alone in the office building. She's a stay-at-home mom, and she's been coming here to work on her resume and job search for the past few months. She's gotten pretty good at sneaking in after everyone has gone home for the night. Tonight, Sandy is sitting at her desk, working on her computer. She's been up for a few hours, and she's starting to get tired. She's just about to call it a night when she hears a noise coming from the other side of the room. Sandy freezes, listening to the noise. It sounds like someone is moving around in the other room. Sandy is terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She slowly gets up from her desk, trying to be as quiet as possible. She creeps toward the door to the other room, listening for the noise. When she gets to the door, she hesitates for a moment, then opens it slowly. Peeking into the other room, Sandy sees a man rummaging through some papers on a desk. The man hasn't seen her, and Sandy is relieved. She's about to turn and run when the man suddenly looks up and sees her. He freezes for a moment, then starts to run toward her. Sandy screams and runs back into the office, slamming the door shut behind her. She presses her back against the door, trying to hold it shut, but the man is pounding on it, trying to get in. Sandy is terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She looks around the room for a way to escape, but the only way out is the door that the man is trying to get through. Sandy is trapped.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy looks around the room for a way to escape, her heart pounding in her chest. She sees a window and runs to it, yanking it open. She scramble onto the fire escape and starts to climb down, her hands shaking. She's almost to the ground when she hears the man pounding on the window, trying to get to her. Sandy screams and jumps the rest of the way to the ground. She starts to run, but she's not sure where to go. She sees a car parked nearby and runs to it, unlock the door and jumps inside. She locks the doors and starts the engine, her hands shaking. She peels out of the parking lot and drives as fast as she can. She's not sure where she's going, but she knows she has to get away from the man. She drives for a few minutes, then sees a police car parked on the side of the road. She pulls over and jumps out of the car, running to the police car. She bangs on the window, screaming for help. The police officer inside wakes up and jumps out of the car, his gun drawn. Sandy is hysterical, and it takes the officer a few minutes to calm her down. When she's finally able to speak, she tells the officer what happened. The officer calls for backup and starts to search the area for the man. Sandy is shaking and terrified, and she's not sure what to do. She wants to go home, but she knows she can't go back to her house. The officer tells her to wait in the car, and she does. She sits in the car, waiting for the officer to return. She's not sure what's going to happen, but she knows she's safe now.
