Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The air is crisp and cold on the mountaintop, with a strong wind blowing. Mashawn is wearing a heavy coat and gloves as he works, shoveling snow off the ground. He pauses occasionally to catch his breath, and looks around at the breathtaking view. In the distance, he can see the town he lives in, and the valleys and hills beyond. Mashawn has been working on this construction project for several weeks now, and he's getting close to finishing. He's been excited to see the finished product, and can't wait to show it off to his friends and family. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a loud noise behind him. He turns around to see a large boulder rolling down the hill towards him. He has just enough time to jump out of the way before it hits him. Mashawn is shaken up but uninjured. He looks at the boulder and sees that it has smashed the section of the wall he was working on. He sighs and starts to shovel the snow back into place. It's going to be a long day.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn continues shoveling snow back into place, trying to block out the sight of the damage the boulder did. He knows that it'll be a long day, and he won't be able to finish before dark. He pauses for a minute to eat some lunch, and then gets back to work. The sun starts to set, and Mashawn is still working. He's exhausted, but he knows he has to finish. Finally, he's done. He steps back to survey his work and is pleased with what he sees. The wall is finished, and it looks just as he imagined it would. He's proud of his work, and can't wait to show it off to his friends and family.
