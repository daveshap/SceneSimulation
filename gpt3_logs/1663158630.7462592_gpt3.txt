Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn climbs to the top of the mountain, his construction tools slung over his shoulder. He's been working on the new resort for weeks, and he's finally reached the summit. The sun is just starting to set, and the view is breathtaking. Mashawn can see for miles in every direction, and the air is crisp and clean. He can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he looks at the progress he and his team have made. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a noise behind him. He turns to see a large, furry creature standing on the edge of the cliff, watching him. Mashawn's heart races as he realizes he's face-to-face with a bear. For a moment, the two of them just stare at each other. Then, the bear lets out a loud roar and charges towards Mashawn. Mashawn doesn't have time to think. He instinctively drops his tools and runs for his life. The bear is right on his heels, but Mashawn manages to make it to safety just in time. He looks back at the bear, still standing on the edge of the cliff, and can't believe he just survived. That was a close call, he thinks to himself, as he starts the long climb back down the mountain.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn's heart is racing as he starts to run down the mountain, the bear close behind him. He can hear the bear's heavy breathing and the sound of its claws scratching the ground as it runs. Mashawn is terrified, but he doesn't have time to think. He just keeps running. Suddenly, he trips on a rock and falls to the ground. The bear is right on top of him. Mashawn closes his eyes, expecting the worst. But then, he hears the bear turn and start to run back up the mountain. Mashawn opens his eyes and sees that the bear is gone. He can't believe he's still alive. He knows he's lucky to be alive, and he's grateful to be able to walk away from this encounter. But he can't help but feel a little bit shaken as he continues his descent down the mountain.
