Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang, a delivery driver, is making his final delivery of the day to an office building. It is evening, and the office is mostly empty, with only a few lights still on in the windows. Wang pulls up to the front of the building and parks his van. He takes the package out of the van and walks up to the front door of the building. He presses the buzzer for the office, and after a moment, someone buzzes him in. Wang walks through the lobby and up to the elevator. He presses the button for the floor his package is going to, and the elevator doors close. Wang rides the elevator up to the correct floor, and walks down the hallway to the correct office. He knocks on the door, and after a moment, someone answers. Wang hands them the package and says goodbye. The person in the office thanks Wang and closes the door. Wang walks back to the elevator and presses the button for the lobby. The elevator doors close, and Wang begins his ride back down to the lobby.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The elevator doors open, and Wang steps out into the lobby. He walks across the lobby to the front door, and presses the button to buzz himself out. After a moment, the door unlocks, and Wang steps out into the cool evening air. He walks back to his van, and climbs inside. He starts the engine, and pulls out of the parking spot. He drives out of the parking lot and onto the street, heading back towards the warehouse. He makes a few turns, and eventually arrives at the warehouse. He pulls up to the loading dock and parks the van. He climbs out of the van and stretches his arms, yawning. He walks into the warehouse, and over to the time clock. He punches out, and then heads towards the locker room. He changes out of his work clothes and into his street clothes. He grabs his bag and heads towards the exit. He waves to the security guard as he walks out of the warehouse, and then he is on his way.
