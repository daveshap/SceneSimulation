LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy continues strolling down the street, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. She's enjoying the nice weather and the busy atmosphere. As she approaches a corner, she notices a group of people gathered around something. She can't see what it is, so she starts to make her way over to see what's going on. As she gets closer, she can see that there's a woman lying on the ground. She looks injured, and Sandy can see a pool of blood forming around her head. Sandy knows she needs to help, so she quickly grabs her phone and dials 911. She tells the dispatcher what's happening and then kneels down next to the woman to see if she can help. The woman is unconscious and Sandy can see that she's still bleeding. She does her best to apply pressure to the wound and keep the woman calm until help arrives.
