SCENE: The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the landscape. Jenna woke up slowly, yawning and stretching as she sat up in her sleeping bag. She rubbed her eyes sleepily, taking in her surroundings. She was camping in the middle of nowhere in Africa, and the silence was deafening. Jenna got up and grabbed her water bottle, taking a long drink before rummaging through her backpack for some breakfast. She munched on a granola bar as she stared out at the vastness of the plains before her. She couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the natural beauty of her surroundings. Suddenly, Jenna heard a loud noise coming from the other side of the camp. She grabbed her camera and started to creep towards the sound, curiosity getting the better of her. She peeked around a tree to see a group of elephants, trumpeting and shuffling around in the mud. Jenna snapped a few pictures before cautiously approaching the animals. She was absolutely fascinated by them. She watched them for a while, before finally packing up her things and heading back on the long journey home. She knew she would never forget this incredible experience.

==========

Jenna packed up her things slowly, her mind still reeling from the incredible experience she had just had. She couldn't believe she had actually seen elephants in the wild! She snapped another picture of them before finally turning away and heading back on the long journey home. She knew she would never forget this incredible experience. The sun was beating down on her mercilessly, and Jenna was starting to get thirsty. She stopped to take a drink from her water bottle, before trudging on through the sandy landscape. She had been walking for hours, and she was starting to get tired. Suddenly, Jenna heard a noise in the distance. She paused, listening intently. It sounded like... footsteps. Jenna's heart started to race as she realized she was being followed. She started to run, but it was too late. She felt a hand clamp down on her mouth from behind, muffling her screams. She was being dragged away into the dense jungle, and she knew she was in trouble.
