Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Sandy is walking through the dark forest, holding her baby close to her. She is getting scared as the sun starts to set and the shadows get longer. She hears a noise in the distance and starts to run, but she trips on a tree root and falls to the ground. She hears the noise getting closer and closer, and she starts to scream for help. Suddenly, a large jaguar appears out of the shadows and starts to attack her. Sandy fights back, but the jaguar is too strong. It drags her away into the darkness, leaving her baby crying alone on the forest floor.
