SCENE: Bob hops out of bed and stretches, taking a deep breath of the cold morning air. He slides his feet into his slippers, and heads downstairs to start a pot of coffee. He puts on a cozy sweater and starts a fire in the fireplace. The dog follows him around, wagging her tail. He puts a pan of water on the stove to boil some eggs, and sets the table. The sun starts to peek over the horizon, and the birds start chirping. The coffee is ready, and Bob sits down to enjoy a quiet breakfast by the fire.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob finishes his breakfast and puts his dishes in the sink. He grabs his coat and hat off the hook by the door and heads outside. The cold air hits him like a brick wall, and he shivers. He starts walking towards town, his breath billowing out in front of him in a white cloud. The dog follows him, happy to be out and about. The streets are empty at this early hour, and Bob feels like the only person in the world. He walks past the bakery, and the smell of fresh bread makes his stomach grumble. He quickens his pace, eager to get home and warm up by the fire.
