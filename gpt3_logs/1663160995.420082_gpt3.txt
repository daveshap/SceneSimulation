LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna is sitting at a table on the porch of her country cottage, enjoying a leisurely lunch. She's got a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, and she's feeling pretty good about life. It's a beautiful day, and she's surrounded by the peace and quiet of the countryside. She takes a bite of her sandwich and a sip of her lemonade, and she lets out a contented sigh. She's just about to take another bite when she hears a noise. It's a car. She doesn't get many visitors out here, so she's curious to see who it is. She gets up from her chair and goes to see who it is. It's her neighbor, Mrs. Saunders. Mrs. Saunders is an elderly woman who lives down the road. She's always been kind to Jenna, and Jenna is happy to see her. "Hello, Mrs. Saunders," Jenna says. "It's nice to see you. What brings you out here today?" "Oh, I just wanted to check on you, dear," Mrs. Saunders says. "I saw that you were having lunch, and I thought I'd come by and say hello. I hope I'm not interrupting anything." "No, not at all," Jenna says. "Please, join me for lunch. I have plenty." "Oh, no, dear, I couldn't impose," Mrs. Saunders says. "Nonsense," Jenna says. "I'd love the company. Please, sit down." Mrs. Saunders hesitates for a moment, then decides to accept Jenna's invitation. She sits down at the table, and Jenna gets her a sandwich and a glass of lemonade. They chat for a while, enjoying the nice day and each other's company.
