Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's dusk, and the last rays of sunlight are filtering through the trees surrounding the cottage. A warm breeze is blowing, and the air is scented with the fragrance of wildflowers. Swathi is sitting on the porch, sipping a cup of tea and watching the fireflies flit about in the meadow. She's feeling content and peaceful, and her worries seem to have melted away. She's been looking forward to this vacation for weeks, and now she's finally able to relax and enjoy herself.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

It's now nighttime, and the stars are shining bright overhead. The fireflies have all disappeared, and the only sound is the gentle rustling of the leaves in the breeze. Swathi is still sitting on the porch, and she's starting to feel a bit sleepy. She's had a long day of travel and she's ready to drift off into a peaceful slumber. She takes one last sip of her tea and then sets the cup down on the porch railing. She stands up and stretches her arms overhead, taking a deep breath of the cool night air. Then she heads inside the cottage, ready to call it a day.
