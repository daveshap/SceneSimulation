SCENE: Gabbi is a babysitter who is currently sitting in an office building waiting for her employer to come pick her up. It is 6pm and Gabbi is getting a bit antsy as she has been sitting in the same spot for the past few minutes. She looks around the office and sees that it is fairly empty, with only a few people milling about. Gabbi taps her foot impatiently and sighs.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Finally, Gabbi's employer arrives to pick her up. Gabbi stands up and stretches, relieved to be getting out of the office. Her employer apologizes for being late and explains that she was held up in a meeting. Gabbi nods understandingly as they make their way out of the building. Once they are outside, Gabbi's employer asks her if she wants to grab a quick bite to eat before they head home. Gabbi's stomach grumbles and she realizes that she is actually quite hungry. She agrees to go to the nearby fast food restaurant and they order their food. While they are waiting for their food, Gabbi's employer asks her about her day. Gabbi tells her about the office building and how it was quite empty. Her employer nods, understanding how that could be boring. They chat for a few more minutes until their food is ready. Gabbi's employer pays for their food and they head back out to the car. Gabbi is grateful for the delicious food and is feeling much more relaxed now. They drive home and Gabbi says goodbye to her employer. She is looking forward to going home and relaxing for the rest of the evening.
