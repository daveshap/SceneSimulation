SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the quiet beach. Mashawn, a construction worker, is walking along the water's edge, enjoying the peacefulness of the morning. He stops to pick up a shell, admiring its delicate curves. Suddenly, he hears the sound of a motor in the distance and turns to see a speedboat racing towards the shore.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn's eyes widen as he realizes the speedboat is headed straight for the shore. He starts to run towards the water, but he knows he won't make it in time. The boat is getting closer and closer, and Mashawn can see the people on board are panicked. He waves his arms and yells, but they can't hear him over the sound of the motor. The boat is only a few feet away from the shore when Mashawn makes a desperate dive for it. He grabs the edge of the boat and hangs on as it speeds away.
