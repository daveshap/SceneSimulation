SCENE: Mashawn is a construction worker who is currently working on the renovation of the Eiffel Tower. It is now 6pm and he is just about to finish his shift. He climbs down from the scaffolding and stretches his aching muscles. He looks up at the Tower, admiring his handiwork. He then turns to go home but is stopped by his boss. His boss tells him that there is one more task that needs to be done before they can call it a day. They need to move one of the large beams that is blocking the entrance to the Tower. Mashawn groans but agrees to help. He and his fellow workers spend the next hour trying to move the beam but it is too heavy. They are just about to give up when Mashawn has an idea. He climbs back up to the scaffolding and loosens one of the bolts. The beam falls to the ground with a loud thud. The workers cheer and pat Mashawn on the back. His boss looks relieved and tells him that he can go home. Mashawn grabs his things and heads home, tired but satisfied.
