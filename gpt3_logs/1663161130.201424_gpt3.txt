SCENE: Jenna is sitting in an office building, waiting for her after-school job to start. She's wearing a button-down shirt and khakis, and she looks a bit out of place among the sea of suits. She's tapping her foot impatiently, and she keeps checking her phone. Every few minutes, she stands up and pace around the room. Finally, at 6pm, her boss arrives.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Finally, at 6pm, Jenna's boss arrives. He's a heavyset man in a cheap suit, and he looks like he's sweating. He mops his brow with a handkerchief as he comes over to Jenna. "Hey, sorry I'm late," he says. " traffic was a nightmare." Jenna just shrugs. She's used to her boss being late. "So, what do you have for me tonight?" he asks. "Just some paperwork," Jenna replies. "Nothing too exciting." Her boss sighs. "Well, let's get to it then." He leads Jenna into his office, and she gets to work.
