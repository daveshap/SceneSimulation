Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Wang had been driving his scooter along the beach all morning, making deliveries for the local businesses. It was now lunch time, and he was hungry. He decided to take a break and sit down on the beach to eat his lunch. He sat down on the sand and began to eat his rice and vegetable dish. He looked out at the water and saw the waves crashing against the shore. He watched as the seagulls flew overhead, looking for food. It was a peaceful scene. After he finished his lunch, Wang lay back on the sand and dozed off. He was content, surrounded by the sounds of the waves and the smell of the sea.
