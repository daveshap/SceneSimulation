Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is walking through the dark forest, holding her baby close to her. She is getting scared as the sun starts to set and the shadows get longer. She hears a noise in the distance and starts to run, but she trips on a tree root and falls to the ground. She hears the noise getting closer and closer, and she starts to scream for help. Suddenly, a large jaguar appears out of the shadows and starts to attack her. Sandy fights back, but the jaguar is too strong. It drags her away into the darkness, leaving her baby crying alone on the forest floor.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy's screams echo through the forest as the jaguar drags her away. Her baby is left crying alone on the ground, its little arms outstretched towards its mother. The sun has almost set now, and the shadows are getting longer and longer. Suddenly, there is a rustling in the bushes and the baby starts to cry even louder. A large snake slithers out of the undergrowth and starts to make its way towards the baby. The baby sees the snake and tries to scoot away, but it is too weak and tired to move. The snake gets closer and closer, its cold body slithering across the ground. It opens its mouth, ready to strike, when there is a loud noise from the bushes. A large bird swoops down and grabs the snake in its talons, carrying it away into the night. The baby is now alone in the dark forest, its mother nowhere to be found.
