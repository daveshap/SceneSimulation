Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is beating down on the concertgoers as they sway to the music. Sandy is standing in the middle of the crowd, her eyes closed and her arms raised above her head. She's lost in the music, dancing and singing along with the rest of the crowd. She's wearing a flowy dress and her hair is pulled back in a messy bun. She looks like she's having the time of her life.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continues to beat down relentlessly on the concertgoers, who are now drenched in sweat. Sandy's flowy dress is sticking to her skin and her hair is starting to fall out of her bun. She doesn't seem to notice the discomfort though, as she's still lost in the music, dancing and singing along with the rest of the crowd. The crowd starts to thin out as the sun sets and the temperature drops. Sandy is one of the last people to leave, her dress now muddy and her hair a tangled mess. She's still smiling though, as she's clearly had the time of her life.
