LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continues to set, casting a beautiful orange glow over the city. Sandy's children are now running and playing around the Eiffel Tower, laughing and having a great time. Sandy is still enjoying the quiet of the evening, watching her children and taking in the beauty of the city. As the evening starts to get darker, Sandy's children begin to tire and they come back to the picnic blanket to snuggle up with their mother. They all look up at the Eiffel Tower, now lit up with thousands of sparkling lights. They all admire the view for a few minutes before Sandy starts to pack up the picnic. Once everything is packed up, Sandy and her children start to walk back to their hotel. They are all tired from their busy day, but they are also happy and content. Sandy blesses her children and gives them a good night kiss before they all head to bed, dreaming of their magical day at the Eiffel Tower.
