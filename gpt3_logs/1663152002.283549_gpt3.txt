==========

Tom enters his bedroom and closes the door behind him. He walks over to the window and looks outside. The sun is beginning to set and the sky is a beautiful orange color. He then walks over to his bed and sits down. He looks around the room and sees that everything is in its place. He then gets up and walks over to his dresser. He opens the top drawer and pulls out a pair of clean socks. He then goes over to his closet and takes out a pair of jeans and a shirt. He gets dressed and then walks over to the mirror. He looks at himself and makes sure that he looks presentable. He then Brussels his hair and heads out of the room.
