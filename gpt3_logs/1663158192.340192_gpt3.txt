SCENE: It's lunch time, and the office building is bustling with activity. Bob, the coffee shop owner, is busy serving up the day's specials. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods fills the air, and the sound of laughter and conversation can be heard coming from the nearby tables. The customers are enjoying their food and drink, and the mood is light and cheerful. Bob takes a moment to chat with some of the regulars, and he can't help but smile at the happiness that seems to fill the room. It's times like these that make Bob love his job. He knows that he's providing a service that helps to make people's days just a little bit better, and that's something that he takes a lot of pride in.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The lunch rush dies down and Bob is able to take a break. He sits down at one of the tables and enjoys a cup of coffee and a sandwich. As he eats, he looks around the shop and smiles. He's proud of what he's built here. It may not be much, but it's a special place for a lot of people. Bob is interrupted from his thoughts by the sound of the door opening. He looks up to see a young woman walking in. She looks around nervously, as if she's not sure if she's in the right place. Bob gets up and goes to greet her. "Can I help you?" he asks. "Um, yes," she says. "I'm looking for a job. I saw your sign in the window." Bob smiles and leads her over to the counter. He takes out an application and hands it to her. "Fill this out and I'll be with you in a minute," he says. The woman takes the application and sits down at a table. Bob goes back to his own table and finishes his lunch. He's looking forward to meeting this woman and seeing if she's a good fit for the coffee shop.
