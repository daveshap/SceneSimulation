Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is sitting at her desk in the office, munching on a sandwich and scrolling through her phone. She's wearing her school uniform, and her backpack is sitting next to her chair. She's surrounded by stacks of papers and folders, and the phone is the only thing that's really keeping her attention. Every so often, she glances up at the clock, and then goes back to her phone.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna's phone suddenly vibrates, and she sees that she has a new text message. She opens it and reads the message, her eyes widening in surprise. It's from her best friend, Emily, and it says that she's just seen Jenna's ex-boyfriend, Luke, kissing another girl. Jenna can't believe it - she thought that they were still on good terms after their break-up. She feels her heart start to race and her stomach drop as she realizes that she's still not over Luke. Jenna quickly grabs her things and heads for the door, not even stopping to say goodbye to her co-workers. She knows that she needs to get out of there before she starts to cry. She rushes out of the office and down the street, trying to get as far away from the scene of the betrayal as possible.
