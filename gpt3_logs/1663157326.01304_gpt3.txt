SCENE: Aleksy was working the evening shift at the grocery store when he got a call from his wife. She was frantic and told him to come home right away. Aleksy rushed out of the store and drove home as fast as he could. When he arrived, he found his wife in the backyard, surrounded by their three kids. She was crying and shaking uncontrollably. Aleksy's mind raced as he tried to figure out what was going on. Then he saw it. There was a large, black snake coiled up next to his wife. It was easily the biggest snake he had ever seen. Aleksy's heart sank as he realized what was happening. He slowly approached the snake, careful not to make any sudden moves. His wife was still terrified, but Aleksy did his best to calm her down. He slowly inched closer to the snake, then grabbed it behind the head. He carefully pulled it away from his wife and kids, then threw it as far away from them as he could. Aleksy's wife collapsed into his arms, relieved and grateful that he had arrived when he did. They both knew that it could have ended much worse if Aleksy hadn't been there.
