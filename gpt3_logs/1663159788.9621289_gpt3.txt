Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is working on a construction site in Africa. It's a hot, dusty day and he's sweating profusely. He's operating a jackhammer, breaking up concrete. The noise is deafening. He stops for a break and wipes the sweat from his brow. He takes a sip of water from his canteen and looks around. He sees the other workers, some operating machinery, some lugging heavy loads of materials. He hears a loud roar and looks up to see a lion walking across the site. Everyone stops what they're doing and watches as the lion calmly strolls through the construction site. After a few minutes, the lion moves on and everyone goes back to work. Mashawn picks up his jackhammer and resumes breaking up the concrete.

Mashawn continues working on the construction site, breaking up concrete with his jackhammer. The noise is still deafening, and he's still sweating profusely. He takes another sip of water from his canteen and looks around. He sees the other workers, some operating machinery, some lugging heavy loads of materials. He hears a loud roar and looks up to see a lion walking across the site. Everyone stops what they're doing and watches as the lion calmly strolls through the construction site. After a few minutes, the lion moves on and everyone goes back to work. Mashawn picks up his jackhammer and resumes breaking up the concrete.
