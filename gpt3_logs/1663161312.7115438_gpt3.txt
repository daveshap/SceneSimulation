LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi finishes hanging up her coat and goes to check on the children, who are playing happily in the next room. She smiles as she watches them, feeling grateful for this peaceful moment. Suddenly, there's a loud crash outside. Gabbi runs to the window to see what's happening, her heart racing. She sees a group of men wearing masks and armed with guns. They're shouting and smashing windows. Gabbi realizes they're going to break into the cottage. She races to the children and grabs them, telling them to hide. She desperately looks around for a place to hide them, but there's nowhere safe. The men are getting closer. Gabbi knows they're going to be killed if they're found. She has to do something. She grabs a knife from the counter and hides behind the door, waiting for the men to come inside. She's determined to protect her children, even if it means sacrificing her own life.
