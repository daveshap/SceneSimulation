Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck across the craggy surface of the moon. The early morning sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a long shadow behind the truck. Wang is making his final delivery of the day, a load of construction supplies bound for a lunar base on the far side of the moon. He is tired from the long night of driving, but he knows that he only has a few more minutes to go. He crests a small hill and sees the base in the distance. He presses down on the accelerator and the truck lurches forward. Wang arrives at the base and pulls up to the loading dock. He hops out of the truck and begins unloading the supplies. He works quickly, knowing that he wants to get back to his truck and head home before the sun gets too high in the sky. Within a few minutes, he has finished unloading the supplies and is back in his truck, heading home. He drives across the lunar landscape, the only sound the hum of the truck's engine. He looks up at the sky and sees the Earth, a bright blue-and-white ball hanging in the blackness. He thinks about his family back home and how he can't wait to see them again. He knows that it will be a long time before he's able to return to Earth, but he's happy to be able to work and live on the moon.
