Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the mountainside. A chill wind is blowing, making the trees sway and the leaves dance. Mashawn is standing on the top of the mountain, his arms crossed over his chest to keep warm. He's wearing a heavy coat and a hard hat, and he's looking out over the valley below. In the distance, he can see the construction site where he's been working for the past few weeks. It's a huge project, and he's proud to be a part of it. He can't wait to see the finished product.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn squints as the sun rises higher in the sky, the light becoming brighter and more intense. He can see the construction site in greater detail now, and he can make out the figures of the workers moving around. He can't help but feel a sense of pride as he looks at the progress they've made. The wind picks up, sending a chill through Mashawn. He shivers and pulls his coat tighter around him. He hears the sound of a helicopter in the distance and looks up to see it approaching. It's his ride back to the construction site. He gives one last look at the valley below before turning to head back down the mountain. He can't wait to get back to work and see the finished product.
