Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the cityscape. The streets are already teeming with people rushing to get to work or school. Among them is Sandy, a stay-at-home mom who is out for a morning walk with her baby in a stroller. She savors the peace and quiet of the early morning, enjoying the sights and sounds of the city coming to life. The fresh air feels good after being cooped up indoors all day with her toddler. As she rounds a corner, she sees a commotion up ahead and slows down to see what's going on. A group of people are gathered around a newsstand,reading the latest headlines. Sandy can't help but overhear snippets of their conversation. "Can you believe it? Another terrorist attack in London." "I know. I'm scared to even fly anymore." "These crazy Muslims are going to ruin the world." Sandy quickens her pace, not wanting to get caught up in their worrisome conversation. She has enough to worry about with a young child at home. She doesn't need to add international terrorism to her list of concerns.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy is walking quickly now, her heart racing as she tries to put distance between herself and the group of people. She can feel their eyes on her, boring into her back, and she can sense their suspicion. She is a Muslim, after all, and they undoubtedly think she is the enemy. The hate and bigotry in their voices is palpable, and Sandy is reeling from the encounter. She feels like she can't catch her breath, and she is on the verge of tears. She knows she needs to get away from here before she completely breaks down. She senses someone following her and she quickens her pace, but she is too slow. The man catches up to her and grabs her arm, spinning her around to face him. "What do you know about the attack?" he demands, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. Sandy is terrified, and she can feel herself shaking. She knows she needs to say something, but she is frozen in fear.
