Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun was high in the sky and beating down on the sand which was hot to the touch. Gabbi was watching her two charges, Lila and Timo, as they played in the water. She made sure to keep a close eye on them as she knew that the ocean could be dangerous. The sound of laughter filled the air as the two children played with each other, making sand castles and chasing each other around. Gabbi kept a smile on her face as she watched them, but she was also on alert in case they needed her. After a while, the children started to get hungry so Gabbipack up their things and led them back to the beach house where they would have lunch.
