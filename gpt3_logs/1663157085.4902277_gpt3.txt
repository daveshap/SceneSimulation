Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: As the sun began to set, the concertgoers started to fill the arena. Wang, a delivery driver, was stuck in the middle of the crowd. He tried to move but it was impossible. He was surrounded by people dancing and singing. The music was so loud that he could feel it vibrating through his body. He closed his eyes and tried to enjoy the moment, but after a while, he started to feel claustrophobic. He started to sweat and his heart started to race. He tried to push his way through the crowd but it was impossible. He started to feel lightheaded and dizzy. He tried to scream for help but no one could hear him. He felt like he was going to pass out. Suddenly, he felt a hand on his shoulder and he was pulled out of the crowd. He could breathe again. He opened his eyes and saw a security guard standing next to him. The guard told him to go to the first aid station. Wang nodded and tried to stand up but his legs were weak. The guard helped him to the first aid station where he was given some water and a place to sit down.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The security guard helped Wang to the first aid station where he was given some water and a place to sit down. Wang gulped down the water and tried to catch his breath. His heart was still racing and he felt a little lightheaded but he was starting to feel better. The security guard told him to take it easy for a few minutes and then he would be on his way. Wang nodded and leaned back against the wall. He closed his eyes and tried to calm down. After a few minutes, he felt well enough to stand up and he slowly made his way out of the first aid station. He could see the crowd still dancing and singing but he didn't feel like going back in. He slowly made his way through the crowd and out of the arena. He was relieved to be out of there and he thanked the security guard for his help.
