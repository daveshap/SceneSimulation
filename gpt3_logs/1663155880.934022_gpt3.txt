Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Gabbi was in the middle of her shift when the power went out. Suddenly, the concert hall was plunged into darkness. Gabbi could hear the screams of the children she was babysitting echoing in the darkness. She quickly grabbed onto one of the children's hands and tried to calm them down. With the other hand, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her cell phone to use as a flashlight. She then led the children to the nearest exit.
