Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna walks down the busy sidewalk, her backpack straps cutting into her shoulders. The sun is beating down on her, and she can feel the sweat trickling down her back. She's on her way to meet her friends for lunch, and she can't wait to get out of the heat. As she approaches the restaurant, she sees her friends sitting at a table near the window. They wave her over, and she eagerly makes her way inside. She slides into the seat next to her best friend, Katie, and lets out a sigh of relief. "It's so hot out there," she says, fanning herself with her hand. "I know," Katie responds. "I can't wait for summer to be over." Jenna nods in agreement as she opens the menu. She knows she won't be able to eat much in this heat, but she's determined to at least try.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna scanned the menu, her eyes landing on the roasted chicken sandwich. She was starving, but she knew she wouldn't be able to eat much in this heat. She flagged down the waiter and placed her order, fanning herself with her hand as she waited. The waiter brought her a glass of ice water, and she took a long drink, grateful for the relief. As she set the glass down, she saw her friends chatting and laughing, and she felt a pang of jealousy. She knew they were just friends, but she couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be in a relationship again. She shook her head, trying to push the thoughts out of her mind. She was determined to enjoy her lunch, despite the heat.
