SCENE: Tom is a bartender and is starting to close up shop for the night. He's wiping down the bar and straightening up bottles when he notices a figures walking down the street. The figure is poorly lit and Tom can't quite make out who it is. As the figure gets closer, Tom can see that it's a woman. She looks to be in her early twenties and is wearing a short, form-fitting dress. She has long, dark hair that cascades down her back. She looks lost and confused. Tom wonders if he should say something to her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom finishes wiping down the bar and straightening up the bottles when he notices a figure walking down the street. The figure is poorly lit and Tom can't quite make out who it is. As the figure gets closer, Tom can see that it's a woman. She looks to be in her early twenties and is wearing a short, form-fitting dress. She has long, dark hair that cascades down her back. She looks lost and confused. Tom wonders if he should say something to her. The woman slowly walks up to the bar and looks at Tom with pleading eyes. She opens her mouth to speak, but no words come out. Tom can see that she's shaking and she looks like she's about to collapse. Tom quickly comes out from behind the bar and guides the woman to a stool. He fetches her a glass of water and she gratefully takes a few sips. Tom can see that she's still shaking, so he grabs a blanket from behind the bar and wraps it around her shoulders. The woman finally speaks, her voice shaking. "Thank you," she says. "I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I was walking home and the next thing I knew, I was here. I don't know where here is." Tom can see the fear in her eyes and he tries to think of something to say to reassure her. "It's okay," he says. "You're safe now. Just stay here for a bit and rest, then I'll help you figure out where you need to go."
