Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Jenna wakes up in the middle of the night, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear strange noises coming from outside her bedroom window. cautiously, she gets out of bed and creeps to the window, peeking out through the curtains. She can see shadowy figures moving around in the backyard and her blood runs cold. She knows she should call the police, but she's too scared to move. She stands there frozen, heart racing, until the figures finally disappear into the night. Jenna is relieved, but shaken. She quietly goes back to bed and tries to go back to sleep, but her mind is racing and she can't seem to shake the feeling that someone is watching her.
