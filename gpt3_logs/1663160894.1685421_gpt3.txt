Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The scene is set on the moon, in a small bar located in one of the many lunar colonies. It is mid-afternoon, and the place is mostly empty, with only a few customers sitting at the counter. Tom, the bartender, is wiping glasses and chatting with the customers. Suddenly, the door opens and a man wearing a spacesuit walks in. He removes his helmet, revealing a face that is covered in sweat. Tom greets the man and asks him what he would like to drink. The man orders a beer, and Tom serves him. The man takes a long drink, then sighs and looks around the bar. He asks Tom if there are any jobs available. Tom tells him that there are no open positions at the moment, but the man persists and asks if there is anything he can do to help out around the bar. Tom hesitates for a moment, then decides to give the man a chance. He tells him to stocking the shelves in the back. The man nods and goes to the back room.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The man begins stocking the shelves in the back room, placing the various bottles of liquor in their respective spots. He works quickly and efficiently, and within a few minutes he is done. He comes back out to the main area of the bar, where Tom is still chatting with the customers. Tom sees the man and nods his head in approval. He tells the man to help him clean up the tables and chairs. The man nods and goes to work, wiping down the tables and chairs with a cloth. Within a few minutes, the bar is clean and orderly. Tom thanks the man for his help and tells him he can go. The man nods and walk out of the bar, back into the lunar colony.
