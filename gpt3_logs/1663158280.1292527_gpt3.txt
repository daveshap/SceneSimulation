Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the cottage. Bob is sitting on the porch, enjoying a cup of coffee. The birds are chirping and the breeze is blowing through the leaves. Everything is peaceful and serene. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. Bob gets up and walks to the edge of the porch, peering down the road. A moment later, a car comes into view, kicking up a cloud of dust as it comes to a stop in front of the cottage. The door opens and a woman gets out. She's carrying a suitcase and looks weary from travel. Bob comes down the steps to greet her. "Welcome home, dear," he says, giving her a hug. "It's good to be home," she replies, smiling. They go inside, arm in arm, and the door closes behind them, leaving the cottage peaceful and quiet once again.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The door closes behind Bob and his wife, shutting out the peaceful night. Bob flops down onto the couch and lets out a long sigh. "It's good to be home," he says, picking up the remote. His wife smiles and starts unpacking her suitcase. "I'm going to take a shower," she says, heading towards the bathroom. "Okay, honey," Bob replies, flipping through the channels. After a few minutes, he hears the sound of the shower running. He gets up and walks to the bathroom door, peeking inside. His wife is standing in the shower, her head tilted back and her eyes closed, enjoying the feel of the hot water. "I'm going to bed," Bob says, turning away. "Okay, goodnight," his wife replies, still lost in the moment. Bob goes to his bedroom and gets into bed, and after a few minutes, he hears his wife come into the room and get into bed next to him. They snuggle close and fall asleep, happy to be home.
