Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is a delivery driver who is currently on his lunch break. He's sitting on a bench near his truck, enjoying a meal of rice and beans. The sun is beating down on him, but he doesn't mind. He's used to the heat. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise. He looks up and sees a herd of elephants stampeding towards him. He knows he won't be able to outrun them, so he quickly jumps into his truck and tries to start it. The engine roars to life and he hits the gas, speeding away from the dangerous animals. He breathes a sigh of relief as he puts some distance between himself and the elephants. That was a close one!

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang drives for another hour, making sure to stay well away from any potential herds of elephants. He's almost to his destination when he sees something strange up ahead. It looks like there's a large group of people blocking the road. He slows down as he approaches, trying to figure out what's going on. As he gets closer, he realizes that they're protesters. They're holding signs and shouting things that he can't quite make out. He's not sure what they're protesting, but he knows he needs to get through. He honks his horn and tries to inch his way forward, but the protesters won't let him through. He's not sure what to do. He doesn't want to cause a scene, but he also has a delivery to make. He inch his way forward again, but this time he gets a rock thrown at his truck. Now he's getting angry. He revs his engine and plows forward, scattering the protesters in all directions. He feels bad about running them over, but he knows he had to get through. He'll just have to explain to his boss what happened.
