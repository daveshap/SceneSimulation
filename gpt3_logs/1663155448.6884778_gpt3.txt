Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's a peaceful country cottage in the middle of the night. Wang, a delivery driver, is making his rounds when he notices something strange. He can't quite put his finger on it, but something seems off. He cautiously approaches the cottage and peers in through the window. Inside, he sees a woman lying on the floor, unmoving. He knows he needs to act fast. He kicks down the door and rushes to her side. She's still breathing, but she's unresponsive. Wang calls 911 and stays with her until the ambulance arrives. It's a scary moment, but Wang is glad he was able to help.
