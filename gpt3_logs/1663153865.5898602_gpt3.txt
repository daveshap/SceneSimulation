Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's noon, and the sun is high in the sky, casting a dappled light through the leaves of the trees. Aleksy is taking his lunch break in a small clearing in the forest. He's sitting on a fallen tree trunk, munching on a sandwich and enjoying the quiet. Suddenly, Aleksy hears a noise in the bushes. He freezes, listening intently. It sounds like someone, or something, is coming closer. Aleksy slowly reaches into his pocket for his knife, his heart pounding in his chest. The bushes part, and Aleksy finds himself face to face with a large, furry creature. It's a monkey! The monkey stares at Aleksy for a moment, then reaches out and snatches the sandwich right out of his hand. Aleksy is so surprised that he drops his knife. The monkey sits on the tree trunk and begins to eat the sandwich, watching Aleksy the whole time. Aleksy is too shocked to move. After a few moments, he slowly reaches for his knife and stands up. The monkey jumps down and runs off into the forest, disappearing from sight. Aleksy is shaking as he walks back to the grocery store. He's never seen anything like that before, and he's not sure what to make of it.
