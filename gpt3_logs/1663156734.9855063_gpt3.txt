Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The babysitter, Gabbi, was in the office building when she received a call from the parents of the children she was supposed to be babysitting. They told her that they would be home late and asked her to stay with the kids until they got back. Gabbi agreed and went to the children's room to check on them. They were both asleep, so she decided to watch TV in the living room. After a while, she started to feel tired and decided to lay down on the couch. She must have fallen asleep, because the next thing she knew, she was being shaken awake by the children's father. He told her that they had been home for a while and asked her why she hadn't come to get them. Gabbi apologized and explained that she must have fallen asleep. The father wasn't happy, but Gabbi assured him that she would be more careful in the future. He thanked her for watching the children and she left.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi arrived home after her long night babysitting. She was exhausted and just wanted to go to bed. However, she knew she had to debrief her parents on how the night went first. She told them about how she watched TV in the living room and then fell asleep on the couch. She said she was very sorry for not coming to get them when they got home and promised it would never happen again. Her parents were understanding and told her she could go to bed. Gabbi was relieved and went to her room, where she promptly fell asleep.
