Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's mid-afternoon, and the sun is shining down on the peaceful country cottage. Bob, the coffee shop owner, is sitting on the porch, enjoying the quiet. He's surrounded by a beautiful garden, and he can hear the birds chirping in the trees. Suddenly, he hears a car pull up to the cottage. He gets up to see who it is, and he sees his old friend, John. John is a business owner, and he's come to Bob for advice. They sit down on the porch, and John tells Bob about his problem. He's been having a lot of trouble with his employees, and he doesn't know what to do. Bob listens carefully and offers his advice. After a few minutes, John thanks Bob and gets back in his car. Bob watched him drive away, and then he went back to his book.
