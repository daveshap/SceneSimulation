SCENE: It's getting dark and Gabbi has to get home, but she's lost. She's been walking for hours, and she's getting scared. She's tried calling her parents, but there's no service. She's tried to find her way back to the house where she was babysitting, but she's completely lost. Suddenly, she hears something in the bushes. She's terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She stands there, frozen, as the thing in the bushes comes closer and closer. She can see it now... it's a big, dark, furry creature. It's a bear! The bear is coming towards her, and she's too scared to move. She's sure she's going to be killed, but then the bear just walks right past her. She's so relieved, she almost falls over. Gabbi knows she has to keep moving, but she's so tired and scared. She doesn't know how much longer she can go on. She's about to give up when she sees a light in the distance. She starts walking towards it, and she soon sees that it's a campfire. There are people around the campfire, and they see her coming. They call out to her, and she's so relieved. She's finally found her way out of the forest.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi slowly approaches the campfire, her heart pounding in her chest. She can't believe she's finally found her way out of the forest. The people around the campfire look up as she approaches. They look relieved to see her. "Thank goodness you're here," one of them says. "We were starting to worry." Gabbi can't help but smile. She's never been so happy to see other people. They help her sit down by the fire and give her something to eat and drink. She's exhausted, but she feels much better now that she's out of the forest. "Thank you so much for helping me," she says to the group. "Don't worry about it," one of them replies. "We're just glad you're safe."
