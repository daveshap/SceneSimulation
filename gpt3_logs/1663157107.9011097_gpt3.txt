Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob is sitting in his bedroom, relaxing after a long day at work. He's sitting in an old, comfortable chair, with a cup of coffee in hand. The room is fairly simple, with a bed, a dresser, and a few other pieces of furniture. There are no decorations on the walls or anything else that would personalize the space. It's clear that Bob doesn't spend a lot of time in here. He takes a sip of his coffee and lets out a sigh. It's been a long day and he's ready to relax. He's just about to take another sip when he hears a knock at the door. He gets up to answer it and finds his neighbor, Mrs. Anderson, standing there. "Hello, Bob," she says. "I was just wondering if you could help me with something." Bob sets his coffee down and invites Mrs. Anderson into the house. She explains that her son is in the hospital and she's having a hard time getting ahold of her husband. She asks if Bob can watch her daughter for a few hours. Bob agrees to help, and Mrs. Anderson hands him a key. She thanks him and hurries off. Bob closes the door and heads back to his bedroom, where he finishes his coffee and contemplates his evening.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob finishes his coffee and sets the mug down on the dresser. He stands up and stretches, letting out a yawn. He wanders over to the bed and flops down, staring up at the ceiling. His mind is racing and he can't seem to relax. He hears a noise from the other room and sits up, alert. He listens for a moment, but there's nothing. He gets up and goes to the door, peeking out into the hallway. He doesn't see anything, so he goes back into the bedroom and tries to lie down again. But he can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. He gets up and goes to the window, peeking out through the blinds. He doesn't see anything out of the ordinary, but he decides to go check on Mrs. Anderson's daughter just to be safe. He grabs the key from the dresser and heads out into the hallway, locking the door behind him. He hurriedly makes his way to Mrs. Anderson's house and unlocks the door, stepping inside. He calls out for the young girl, but there's no answer. He starts to feel uneasy and begins to search the house, calling out her name. He doesn't find her anywhere, and he starts to worry that something has happened to her. He goes back outside and ends up finding her playing in the backyard. He breathes a sigh of relief and goes over to talk to her. They chat for a bit before he heads back home, his mind now at ease.
