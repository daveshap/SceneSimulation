==========

Bob is standing in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He's holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a book in the other, and he looks like he's enjoying himself immensely. He's tapping his foot along to the beat and swaying slightly from side to side, and every now and then he takes a sip of his coffee. He's clearly in his element here, surrounded by the music and the people.
