SCENE: Tom loved his job as a bartender, especially when he got to work in unique places like under the Eiffel Tower. He loved watching the sunset from his spot behind the bar, and he loved chatting with the tourists who came to visit. Tonight, the sunset was especially beautiful, and the bar was packed with people from all over the world. Tom was busy making drinks and chatting with customers, but he always made time to appreciate the view. As the sun began to set, Tom noticed a young couple standing near the edge of the bar, gazing up at the Tower. They were holding hands and whispering to each other, and Tom could see the love and happiness in their eyes. It was moments like this that made Tom love his job. He was happy to be able to share in the joy of others, and to help make their memories of Paris even more special.

Tom finished up his shift as the last rays of sunlight disappeared behind the Eiffel Tower. He wiped down the bar and said goodbye to the customers, most of whom were still staring up at the beautiful structure. As he walked out from under the Tower, he saw the young couple he'd been watching earlier. They were still holding hands and whispering to each other, and they looked as happy as ever. Tom smiled to himself and walked away, thinking about how lucky he was to have a job that let him share in the joy of others.
