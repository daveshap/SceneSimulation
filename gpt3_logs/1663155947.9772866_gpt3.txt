The sun is shining brightly as Jenna walks up the mountaintop. She's enjoying the view of the valley below when she notices a small group of people in the distance. She can't tell what they're doing, but it looks like they're having a picnic. Jenna starts to make her way down the mountain to see if she can join in on the fun. As she gets closer, she can see that it's a group of her classmates. They look like they're having a great time, laughing and joking with each other. One of the girls, sees Jenna and calls out to her. Jenna's face lights up as she realises that she's been invited to join them. She hurriedly makes her way over and takes a seat on the blanket. The group chats and laughs together as they enjoy their lunch. Jenna feels happy and grateful to be included in this special moment with her friends.
