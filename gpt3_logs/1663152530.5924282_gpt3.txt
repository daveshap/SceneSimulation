Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Aleksy is a grocery store clerk who is currently taking a smoke break under the Eiffel Tower. It is dusk, and the tower is illuminated with bright lights. Aleksy is enjoying the view and admiring the architecture when he suddenly hears a loud noise. He looks up to see a large object falling from the top of the tower. He realizes it is a person and starts to run, but it is too late. The person hits the ground with a thud, narrowly missing Aleksy. He is horrified and starts to tremble. He looks around to see if anyone else saw what happened, but no one is around. He decides to go back to the grocery store and pretend like nothing happened.
