SCENE: Wang is a delivery driver who is currently making a delivery to a bedroom in a house. It is lunch time, and Wang is hoping to get the delivery done quickly so that he can get something to eat himself. As Wang enters the bedroom, he sees the customer lying in bed, with a tray of food next to them. Wang felt a pang of jealousy as he realised that the customer was about to enjoy a delicious-looking meal, while he would have to wait until he got back to the delivery depot to eat. Wang quickly deposit the delivery in the bedroom and then left, his stomach growling.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang trudges back to the delivery depot, his stomach growling all the way. He can't help but think about the delicious-looking meal the customer was about to enjoy, and how he himself will have to wait a while longer before he can eat. He eagerly grabs his own lunch from the fridge and sits down to eat, savouring every bite. He can't help but feel a little envious of the customer, but he's just happy to finally have something to eat.
