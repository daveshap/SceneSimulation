==========

Bob continues to sit on the sand, watching the waves and sipping his coffee. The sky begins to darken, and the stars come out. Bob hears the sound of voices and laughter coming from the direction of the beach house. He gets up and dusts the sand off of his pants. He walks towards the house, and as he gets closer, he can see that the lights are on and people are inside. He can hear music playing and people talking and laughing. He walks up to the door and knockson it.
