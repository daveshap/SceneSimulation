He's also getting a bit worried, because he's not sure how much farther he has to go. Bob is getting ready to give up and turn back when he sees a clearing up ahead. He walks towards it, and sure enough, there is a coffee shop there. Bob is relieved and happy to have found the place. He walks up to the shop and goes inside. The shop is empty, and it looks like it hasn't been used in a long time. Bob looks around, and he sees a coffee pot on the counter. He walks over to it and starts to make some coffee. Suddenly, Bob hears a noise outside. He freezes, and he listens carefully. It sounds like someone is coming. Bob hides behind the counter and waits. The person comes into the shop, and Bob can see that it's a woman. She's carrying a gun, and she looks around the shop cautiously. Bob stays hidden and watches as the woman goes over to the coffee pot and starts to make some coffee. After a few minutes, the woman relaxes and puts her gun down. She takes a cup of coffee and sits down at a table. Bob waits for a few minutes, and then he comes out from behind the counter. He walks over to the woman and sits down at the table with her. They start to talk, and Bob soon learns that the woman is a professional bounty hunter. She's been hired to find him and bring him back to the United States. Bob is surprised, but he's not scared. He knows that he's innocent, and he's confident that he can prove it. He tells the bounty hunter his story, and she listens carefully. At the end of his story, the bounty hunter tells Bob that she believes him. She says that she's going to help him clear his name. Bob is relieved and happy to have someone on his side.
