Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is walking down the street after school, her backpack slung over one shoulder. The city bustles around her, the sidewalks crowded with people hurrying to get home from work or running errands. The air is alive with the sound of car horns honking and brakes squealing. The buildings around Jenna are tall and close together, their windows reflecting the light of the setting sun. As Jenna walks, she glances up at the windows of the buildings around her, her eyes drawn to the bright lights and movement inside. She sees people sitting at desks, talking on the phone or typing on computers. She sees families gathered around tables, eating dinner together. She even sees a group of kids her own age playing a video game in one of the apartments. Jenna feels a pang of envy as she watches the group of kids. She wishes she could be hanging out with her friends too, but she has to get home to help her mom with dinner. With a sigh, Jenna turns away from the window and continues on her way.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna walks for a few more blocks, her mind on the group of kids she saw playing video games. She wonders what it would be like to have friends to hang out with after school. Jenna is so lost in thought that she doesn't notice the group of boys walking behind her until it's too late. She feels a hard push from behind and stumbles, her backpack flying off her shoulder. Jenna falls to the ground, skinning her knees. She looks up to see the group of boys laughing and running away. Jenna feels her eyes fill with tears as she tries to stand up. Her backpack is lying in a puddle a few feet away, and her knees are throbbing. Jenna starts to limp towards her backpack when she hears someone calling her name. Jenna turns to see her neighbor, Mrs. Garcia, coming towards her.
