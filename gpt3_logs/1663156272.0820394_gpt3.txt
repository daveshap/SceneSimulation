==========

It's lunch time, and Aleksy is up on the mountaintop enjoying the view. He's brought his lunch with him, and is sitting on a large rock enjoying the quiet. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him, and turns to see a group of goats coming up the mountain. They're followed by a woman who's herding them. Aleksy greets the woman and they start chatting. The woman tells him that she's been herding goats for years, and that it's a tough but rewarding job. She asks Aleksy what he does, and he tells her that he's a grocery store clerk. The woman is interested in hearing about Aleksy's job, and they chat for a while before she has to go back to her goats. Aleksy waves goodbye, and goes back to his lunch.
