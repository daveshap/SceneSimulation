LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continues to set, and the sky grows darker. The waves continue to crash against the shore, and the smell of salt is still in the air. Sandy is starting to feel sleepy and decides to go for a walk. She walks along the beach, admiring the view. After a while, she comes across a group of people who are having a bonfire. They invite her to join them, and she sits down by the fire. She chats with them for a while and then decides to head back to her kids. When she gets back to the beach, they are fast asleep. She covers them up with a blanket and then sits down to enjoy the rest of the evening.
