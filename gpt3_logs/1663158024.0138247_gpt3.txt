Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Gabbi is sitting on the moon, eating her lunch and enjoying the view. She's been babysitting for the past few hours and is ready to take a break. It's a beautiful day on the moon, and she's surrounded by the bright, white landscape. She can see the Earth in the distance, and it looks so peaceful. She's happy to be able to sit and relax for a few minutes before she has to go back to work.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi finishes her lunch and stretches her arms above her head. It's been a nice break, but she knows she needs to get back to work soon. She stands up and brushes the sand off her clothes. As she looks around, she notices something shining in the distance. She squints her eyes and tries to see what it is, but she can't quite make it out. She starts walking towards it, and as she gets closer, she realizes it's a spaceship. She starts running towards it, and as she gets closer, she can see someone inside. They're waving at her, and she can see they're trying to signal her to come aboard. Gabbi knows she needs to go back to work, but she can't resist the temptation to explore. She climbs aboard the spaceship and the door closes behind her.
