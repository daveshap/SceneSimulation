SCENE: Aleksy had been working the night shift at the grocery store for nearly a year now, and he was used to the ebb and flow of the late-night customers. But tonight, things were different. It was dead quiet. Not a single soul had come in or out of the store in hours. The stillness was unnerving. Aleksy tried to take his mind off of it by straightening up the shelves and mopping the floors, but eventually he ran out of things to do. He leaned against the counter and watched the minutes tick by on the clock, longing for the shift to end. Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from the back of the store. Something was moving around in the stockroom. Aleksy's heart started to race. He had never been back there alone at night before, and the thought of someone else being in the store with him was terrifying. He slowly made his way to the back, his hand trembling as he reached for the light switch. He flipped it on, and the stockroom was immediately bathed in light. Aleksy swallowed hard, mustering up the courage to take a step into the room. But before he could take even one step, he heard the back door swing open. Someone was coming in. Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he cowered in the stockroom, waiting for the intruders to make their way into the store. But instead of the footsteps he was expecting, he heard a strange, ethereal voice. "Aleksy," the voice said. "We've been waiting for you."

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he cowered in the stockroom, waiting for the intruders to make their way into the store. But instead of the footsteps he was expecting, he heard a strange, ethereal voice. "Aleksy," the voice said. "We've been waiting for you." Aleksy was frozen in place, paralyzed by fear. He didn't know what to do or where to run. The voice seemed to be coming from all around him, surrounding him. And then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a figure materialize in the stockroom. The figure was shrouded in a cloak, its face hidden in the shadows. But Aleksy could feel its eyes on him, piercing through the darkness. "Who are you?" he asked, his voice trembling. "We are the spirits of this store," the figure replied. "We have been trapped here for years, ever since the store closed down. But we knew that one day, someone would come along and free us. And that day is today." Aleksy was still trying to wrap his head around what was happening. He didn't know what to say or do. But the spirits of the store were waiting for him to make a decision. He could either stay and freed them, or he could run away and leave them trapped forever. Aleksy took a deep breath and steeled himself. He knew what he had to do. "I'll stay," he said. "I'll help you." As he took a step forward, the spirits of the store began to dissipate. They were thanking him, thanking him for his courage. And Aleksy knew that he had made the right decision. He was going to help these spirits move on to the next phase of their journey.
