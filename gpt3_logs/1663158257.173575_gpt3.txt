Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is beating down on the savannah, sending waves of heat up from the parched earth. In the distance, Sandy can see a herd of zebras grazing, theirstripes providing little relief from the intense heat. Closer to her, a group of baboons are engaged in a spirited game of chase, leaping and bounding through the scrubby vegetation. Sandy is sitting in the shade of a acacia tree, watching her two young children play. Her toddler is busy digging in the sand, while her older child is chasing butterflies. Every now and then, Sandy's gaze wanders to the horizon, where she can see the hazy outline of mountains in the distance. It's another day in Africa, and Sandy is content to while away the hours watching her children play and the wildlife go about their business.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy's toddler is busy digging in the sand, while her older child is chasing butterflies. Every now and then, Sandy's gaze wanders to the horizon, where she can see the hazy outline of mountains in the distance. It's another day in Africa, and Sandy is content to while away the hours watching her children play and the wildlife go about their business. Suddenly, Sandy hears a loud commotion coming from the direction of the zebra herd. She stands up to get a better look and sees a large lioness stalking towards the zebras. The lioness is clearly carnivore hungry, and Sandy knows that it's only a matter of time before the lioness makes a kill. Sandy knows that she can't just sit by and watch the lioness hunt down one of the zebras, so she grabs her children and starts running towards the herd in an attempt to scare the lioness away. The lioness sees Sandy and her children running towards her and decides to abandon her hunt. She turns and sprints away in the opposite direction, leaving the zebras safe for now. Sandy and her children are panting and out of breath by the time they reach the herd. Sandy's heart is racing and she knows that they were lucky that the lioness didn't decide to attack them. Sandy takes a moment to calm her nerves before heading back to the tree where she was sitting earlier. She knows that it's not safe to stay out in the open for too long, not with predators like lions roaming around. As Sandy walks back to the tree, she can't help but feel a sense of awe at the power and majesty of the lioness. Even though she was scared, Sandy knows that she was privileged to witness such a beautiful and deadly creature up close.
