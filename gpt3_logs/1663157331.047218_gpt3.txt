Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the quiet beach, and Wang is finishing up his delivery route. He's been working since early this morning, and he's looking forward to getting home to his family. Wang climbs into his truck and starts the engine. He's about to head home when he sees a group of people walking along the beach. They're carrying baskets and bags, and Wang wonders if they're going to set up a stall or something. He's about to drive off when he sees a woman in the group wave to him. He knows her - she's one of his regular customers. He decides to stop and see if she needs help. The woman greets him and asks him to help carry some of the baskets to her car. Wang agree and starts to help. He's soon joined by other members of the group, and they all make their way to the woman's car. They load up the car and say their goodbyes. Wang watches as the group drives off, before heading home himself.
