SCENE: The sun is high in the sky, beating down on the savannah with a blazing heat. Swathi is out on a nature walk, enjoying the fresh air and incredible wildlife. She's been marveling at the lions and elephants all morning, and now she's stopped to take a break in the shade of a massive tree. Swathi is sitting on the ground, leaning against the tree trunk. She's taken off her shoes and socks, and is enjoying the feel of the grass on her feet. She's sipping from a bottle of water, and nibbling on a granola bar. She's feeling happy and relaxed, surrounded by the beauty of nature. Suddenly, she hears a loud rustling in the bushes nearby. Her heart starts to race as she wonders what kind of animal is coming towards her. Is it a dangerous predator? She slowly gets to her feet, ready to run if necessary. But then, out from the bushes, emerges a curious looking gazelle. It boldly approaches Swathi, sniffing at her feet and clothes. Swathi is surprised, but delighted, by this friendly encounter. She slowly reaches out to pet the gazelle, and it leans into her touch. After a few moments, the gazelle wanders off, and Swathi is once again alone in the savannah. She resumes her walk, feeling even more connected to this special place.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The gazelle wanders off into the bushes, and Swathi continues on her walk. She marvels at the different plants and animals she sees, and feels thankful for the chance to experience this amazing place. As she walks, she notices a small bird flitting around in the bushes. It's so fast she can barely see it, but she's enchanted by its beauty. She stops to watch it for a few moments, until it suddenly flies away. With a smile, she resumes her walk. She doesn't get far before she hears a loud crashing sound. She freezes, her heart racing. What could it be? Is there a dangerous animal nearby? She slowly backs away, ready to run if necessary. But then she hears a light chuckle, and she realizes the noise was just a herd of elephants playing around. She laughs in relief, and watch the elephants for a while before continuing on her walk. The sun is starting to get lower in the sky, and Swathi knows she should head back soon. But she's having such a nice time, she decides to stay out for just a little while longer. She walks to the edge of a small pond, and sits down to enjoy the peacefulness of the moment. She closes her eyes, and feels the cool breeze on her face. It's been a perfect day.
