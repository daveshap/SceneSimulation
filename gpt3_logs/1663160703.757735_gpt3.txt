Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a dark, gloomy day in the forest, and Swathi is taking her lunch break. She's sitting on a log, eating her sandwich and looking around at the dark trees. There's a feeling of malice in the air, and Swathi can't shake the feeling that something is watching her. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap. She turns around, but there's nothing there. She tells herself it's just her imagination, but she can't help but feel uneasy.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi hears another branch snap and she jumps to her feet, looking around wildly. She scans the area, but there's nothing there. She starts to back away slowly, her heart pounding in her chest. Suddenly, she trips over a log and falls to the ground. She looks up and sees a large, dark figure looming over her. She screams as it grabs her with its long, clawed fingers.
