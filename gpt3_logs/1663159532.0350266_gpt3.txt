Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun beats down mercilessly on the parched landscape. Swathi, a software engineer, is on a research trip in Africa. She is sweating profusely, and her clothing is sticking to her skin. She is surrounded by dense jungle, and the only sound is the cicadas chirping in the trees. Suddenly, she hears a loud rustling in the bushes. She freezes, unsure of what to do. A large snake slithers out from the undergrowth and begins to coil itself around her. She is paralyzed with fear. The snake hisses menacingly and strikes at her with its fangs. She feels a sharp pain in her leg as the venom seeps into her bloodstream. She knows she is in trouble. She tries to scream for help, but the venom is already starting to affect her vocal cords. She feels lightheaded and dizzy. She knows she needs to get help fast, but she doesn't know where to turn.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continues to beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape. Swathi's head is spinning and she feels like she is going to faint. She tries to scream for help again, but the venom has now spread to her lungs and she cannot make a sound. She starts to panic as she realizes that she is going to die if she does not get help soon. She tries to crawl towards the nearest bushes in an attempt to hide from the snake, but her movements are sluggish and she does not get very far. The snake hisses and strikes at her again, injecting more venom into her system. She feels her body start to go numb and she knows she is losing consciousness. She sees the snake coil itself around her one last time before everything goes black.
