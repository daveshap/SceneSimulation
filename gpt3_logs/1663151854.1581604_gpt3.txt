Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's 6pm and Mashawn is just getting home from a long day of work. He's exhausted, but he knows he needs to get started on his chores for the evening. First, he heads to the bedroom to change out of his work clothes. He strips down to his boxers and climbs into bed, letting out a deep sigh of relief. The sheets are cool and feel good against his skin. He close his eyes and allows himself to relax for a few minutes before he gets up to start on his chores.
