SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the city. Aleksy is standing behind the register at the grocery store, yawning and stretching his arms. He's been working the overnight shift, and he's just about ready to call it quits. As he's waiting for the last few customers to finish up their shopping, his mind starts to wander. He thinks about his bed at home, and how good it's going to feel to finally get some rest. He's just about to drift off into a daydream when he hears the front door of the store open. Aleksy snaps to attention and greets the customer with a friendly smile. It's an older woman, and she's carrying a large bag of groceries. Aleksy starts to ring her up, but his mind is still half-asleep. He makes a few mistakes with the pricing, and the woman has to correct him. Finally, the last customer is finished and Aleksy can go home. He grabs his coat from behind the register and heads for the door. As he steps outside, he's greeted by a blast of cold air. He shivers and pulls his coat tighter around himself. He starts the long walk home, his mind already starting to drift off again. He's so tired that he doesn't even notice the cold anymore. He's just focused on getting home and getting into bed.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy is walking down the street, his mind foggy from lack of sleep. He's barely paying attention to where he's going, and he almost doesn't see the man walking towards him. They collide with a hard thud, and Aleksy stumbles backwards. The man yells at him, and Aleksy tries to apologize. The man is getting angry, and he pushes Aleksy. Aleksy falls to the ground, and the man kicks him in the stomach. Aleksy is in pain, and he can't breathe. He tries to get up, but the man kicks him again. Aleksy is trying to protect himself, but the man keeps hitting him. Finally, Aleksy is able to get up and run away. He's terrified, and he doesn't know what to do. He's covered in bruises and he's bleeding, but he keeps running. He doesn't know where he's going, but he knows he has to get away.
