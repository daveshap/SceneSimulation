Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi is walking through a dark forest in South America, her heart pounding in her chest. She's been walking for hours, and she's starting to feel lost. She knows she needs to find her way out soon, before it gets dark. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like somebody is following her. She starts to run, but she's not sure which way to go. The noise gets louder and closer, and she can see somebody running after her. She's about to scream when she trips and falls to the ground. The next thing she knows, she's being dragged off into the woods by somebody. She tries to fight, but it's no use. She's gagged and tied up, and she can't see where she's being taken. She's terrified, and she has no idea what's going to happen to her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi is being dragged through the forest by her captor. She's trying to fight and scream, but it's no use. She's gagged and tied up, and she can't see where she's being taken. She's terrified, and she has no idea what's going to happen to her. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like somebody is following them. Her captor starts to run, and Swathi is dragged behind him. She trips and falls, and she can see her captor getting further and further away. She's about to give up when she hears the noise again. This time, it sounds like it's getting closer. She starts to struggle again, and she manages to get loose. She runs in the opposite direction of her captor and she doesn't stop until she finds a road. She's exhausted and scared, but she's relieved to be out of the forest.
