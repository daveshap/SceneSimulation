Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting behind the mountains, and Bob is watching from his coffee shop. He's got a good view of the valley below, and he can see the lights starting to come on in the homes and businesses down there. It's a peaceful scene, and Bob feels lucky to be able to live and work in such a beautiful place. As he's watching, Bob sees a figures come over the top of the mountain and start down the other side. It's a hiker, he assumes, out for a evening walk. He watches the figure for a while, until they disappear out of view. A few minutes later, Bob sees another figure come over the top of the mountain. This one is moving much faster than the first, and Bob can see that they're carrying something. It looks like a backpack, and they're headed down the mountain at a pretty good clip. Bob wonders if the second hiker is chasing the first, or if they're just in a hurry to get somewhere. Bob continues to watch the mountain, but he doesn't see any more hikers. After a few minutes, he goes back to work, cleaning up the shop for the night.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob finishes cleaning up the shop and heads to the back room to get ready for bed. He undresses and climbs into bed, but he can't seem to fall asleep. He keeps thinking about the two hikers he saw earlier. He wonders what they could have been up to. After a while, he gets up and decides to take a walk. He grabs a flashlight and heads out the back door. He walks to the edge of the property and looks up at the mountain. He can see the lights of the town below, but everything is quiet. He shines his flashlight up the mountain, but he doesn't see any hikers. He decides to head up the trail a ways to see if he can find them. He's only been hiking for a few minutes when he comes across the first hiker. They're lying on the ground, and it looks like they've been attacked. Bob can see wounds on their arms and legs, and there's blood everywhere. He shine his flashlight around, but he doesn't see anyone else. He starts to feel uneasy, and he decides to head back to town.
