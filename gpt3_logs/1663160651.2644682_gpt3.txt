SCENE: It's lunch time, and Mashawn is sitting at his desk in the office, eating his lunch. He's got a sandwich and a can of soda, and he's looking out the window at the construction site across the street. He can see the workers being busy, and he can hear the sound of the equipment they're using. It's a nice day, and Mashawn is enjoying his lunch.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn finishes his lunch and throws away his garbage. He sits at his desk for a few more minutes, looking out the window and enjoying the view. After a few minutes, he gets up from his desk and stretches. He walks over to the window and looks out at the construction site. He can see the workers are still busy. He watches them for a few minutes and then turns and walks back to his desk. He sits down and starts to work on his computer.
