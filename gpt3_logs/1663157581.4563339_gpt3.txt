Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Gabbi sat on the edge of the bed, watching the two children sleeping soundly in their beds. It had been a long day, and she was grateful to finally have a moment to herself. She sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the peace and quiet, before she heard a noise coming from the hallway. She got up quietly, careful not to wake the children, and went to investigate. She saw the outline of a man standing in the shadow at the end of the hallway, and her heart started to race. She knew she should call the police, but she was frozen in fear. The man started to come towards her, and Gabbi backed up into the bedroom, her mind racing. She looked around for a weapon, anything she could use to defend herself, but there was nothing. The man was getting closer and closer, and Gabbi could see the murderous look in his eyes. She knew she was going to die. Just as the man was about to reach her, she heard the sound of sirens in the distance. The man hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran out the front door. Gabbi collapsed to the floor, shaking and crying with relief. The police had arrived just in time.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi sat on the edge of the bed, her heart pounding in her chest. She couldn't believe that the police had arrived just in time. She was shook up, but she was relieved that the man was gone. She slowly got to her feet, her legs trembling. She made her way to the window, peeking out to see the police officers talking to her neighbors. She was about to turn away when she saw the man in the shadows, watching her. Their eyes met, and Gabbi felt a cold chill run down her spine. She knew he was still out there, waiting for her. She was going to have to be careful from now on.
