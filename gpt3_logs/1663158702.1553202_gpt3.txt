Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a dark, moonless night, and Gabbi is babysitting her two young charges in a remote cabin deep in the forest. It's been a long night, and the kids are finally asleep. Gabbi is just about to settle down with a book when she hears a strange noise outside the cabin. She gets up to investigate, and sees a large, furry creature lurking in the shadows. The creature is watching her with its glowing yellow eyes, and Gabbi can see that it's covered in blood. She realizes that it's a werewolf, and she's in serious trouble. The werewolf lashes out at her, but Gabbi is able to dodge its attack. She grabs the children and runs into the woods, the werewolf close behind her. Gabbi is a fast runner, but the werewolf is gaining on her. She knows she can't outrun it, so she looks for somewhere to hide. She finds a large tree with a hollow trunk, and she scrambles inside, pulling the kids in with her. The werewolf howls in frustration outside the tree, but it can't get to them. Gabbi knows they're safe for now, but she knows the werewolf will be back. She has to find a way to kill it before that happens.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi is huddled in the tree trunk with the children, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows the werewolf is out there somewhere, and she knows it's only a matter of time before it comes back. She has to find a way to kill it before that happens. She looks around the tree trunk for something she can use as a weapon, but all she can find are some sticks and leaves. She knows they won't be enough to kill the werewolf, but she has to try. She quietly whispers to the children to stay quiet and still, and then she climbs out of the tree trunk. She crouches down behind a bush, and waits for the werewolf to appear. She knows she only has one chance at this, and she has to make it count. She sees the werewolf lurking in the shadows, and she takes a deep breath. She launches herself out of the bushes and tackles the werewolf to the ground. She plunges her makeshift weapon into the werewolf's heart, and it cries out in pain. It thrashes around for a few moments, and then it's still. Gabbi knows she's done, and she can finally relax. The children are safe, and the werewolf is dead.
