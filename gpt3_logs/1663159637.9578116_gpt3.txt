Sandy is sitting on a bench in the park, watching her kids play. It's a beautiful evening, and the city is alive with lights and sounds. She feels a sense of peace and contentment sitting here in the midst of all this activity. Suddenly, she hears a commotion coming from the other side of the park. She sees a group of people gathering around something, and they seem to be getting agitated. She can't see what's going on from where she's sitting, so she gets up to investigate. As she gets closer, she sees that the crowd is gathered around a man who's lying on the ground. He's clearly injured, and people are trying to help him. Sandy feels a surge of adrenaline as she realizes what's happening, and she rushes over to see if she can help.
