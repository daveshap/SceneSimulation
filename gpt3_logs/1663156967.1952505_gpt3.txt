Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The city is bustling with energy and life as people hurry to and fro, enjoying the evening. Tom is behind the bar, mixing drinks and chatting with the customers. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol and cigarettes. The clinking of glasses and laughter fill the room. A group of young men come in and take a seat at the bar. They are rowdy and loud, ordering shots and beers. Tom serves them and they continue to drink and make noise. One of the men, slightly drunk, gets up from his stool and staggers over to a woman sitting at a nearby table. He starts to hit on her, making crude comments and trying to touch her. The woman is clearly uncomfortable and tries to get away, but the man is persistent. Tom sees what's happening and walks over to the man, telling him to leave the woman alone. The man starts to argue with Tom, getting in his face and threatening him. The other men at the bar get up and start to approach Tom. The situation is getting tense. Suddenly, the doors to the bar burst open and a group of police officers come in. They tell the men to calm down and to leave the premises. The men reluctantly do so, giving Tom dirty looks as they go. Tom breathes a sigh of relief and goes back to tending the bar.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The bar gets back to business as usual after the commotion. Tom goes back to mixing drinks and chatting with customers. The group of young men is long gone, and the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed now. The woman who was harassed by the drunk man is still sitting at her table, nursing a drink. She catches Tom's eye and gives him a small smile of thanks. Tom nods back at her, then goes back to work. Suddenly, the doors to the bar burst open again and the group of police officers come back in. They walk up to Tom and tell him that they've been getting complaints about the bar being a disturbance. Tom is confused and asks what they're talking about. The police officers tell him that there have been multiple reports of fights and rowdy behavior coming from the bar. They say that they're going to have to shut the place down unless Tom can get the situation under control. Tom is horrified and tells the officers that he'll do whatever it takes to keep the bar open. They tell him that they'll be back in a few days to check on the situation. If things haven't improved, the bar will be shut down for good. Tom nods and the officers leave. He stands there for a moment, feeling overwhelmed. Then he takes a deep breath and goes back to work, determined to keep his business afloat.
