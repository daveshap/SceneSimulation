SCENE: The sun is beginning to set over the African plains, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. The temperature is beginning to cool down, making it the perfect time to enjoy a drink. Inside the safari lodge, Tom is busy mixing drinks for the guests. He hums to himself as he works, lost in his own world. The lodge is full of people chatting and laughing, enjoying the peace of the wilderness. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol and perfume. As the night goes on, Tom gets more and more busy. He chats and jokes with the guests, serving them drink after drink. The atmosphere is electric and everyone is having a great time. Tom is in his element, making sure everyone has a good time. Eventually, the lodge starts to quiet down as people head to bed. Tom finishes up his shift and head to his own room, tired but happy.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom finishes up his shift and heads to his own room, tired but happy. He kicks off his shoes and flops down onto the bed, letting out a long sigh. It's been a long night, but it's been a good one. He's glad he could help make everyone's experience at the lodge a good one. He closes his eyes, letting the sounds of the wilderness lull him to sleep. Tomorrow is another day and there's always more work to be done, but for now, he just relaxes and lets the fatigue wash over him.
