SCENE: Jenna was walking along the beach, enjoying the last bit of daylight before it got too dark. The air was still and the waves were crashing gently against the shore. She loved this time of day, when everything seemed so peaceful. Suddenly, she heard a noise behind her and turned around to see a man walking towards her. He looked Asian and was wearing a hoodie, so she couldn't see his face. He was walking quickly and seemed to be carrying something in his hand. Jenna started to feel scared and ran towards the nearest house. The man ran after her and when she looked back, she saw that he had a knife in his hand. She screamed for help, but no one was around. The man caught up to her and pulled her into an alleyway. Jenna begged for her life, but the man didn't say anything. He just stared at her with cold, lifeless eyes. Then, he raised the knife and Jenna felt a sharp pain in her stomach. She collapsed to the ground and everything went black.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna wakes up to the sound of someone screaming. She's disoriented and it takes her a moment to realize that she's in a hospital. She tries to sit up, but is met with a sharp pain in her stomach. She looks down and sees that she's cleanly bandaged up. She lies back down and tries to remember what happened. The last thing she remembers is a man coming towards her with a knife. She starts to cry and a nurse comes into the room to comfort her. Jenna is traumatized and shaken up, but she's alive. The police are called and Jenna gives a description of the man who attacked her. She's unable to give a very detailed description, but they're hoping that someone will come forward with information. In the meantime, Jenna is being monitored closely and is under 24-hour security. She's safe now, but she's changed. This incident has left her scared and feeling vulnerable. She's not sure if she'll ever be able to go back to the beach again.
