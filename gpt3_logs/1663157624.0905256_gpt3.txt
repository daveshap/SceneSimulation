SCENE: Bob is in the middle of a concert, surrounded by people of all ages. He's enjoying the music, tapping his foot along to the beat. The sun is shining and the atmosphere is festive. Suddenly, his cell phone rings. He looks down at the screen and sees that it's his coffee shop. He hesitates for a moment, but then decides to answer. "Hello? Yes, this is Bob. What can I do for you?" He listens for a moment, a look of concern spreading across his face. "Oh no, that's not good. I'll be right there." He hangs up the phone and starts to make his way through the crowd, apologizing as he bumps into people. He's obviously in a hurry, and people are starting to notice. "Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry, I have to go." He finally makes it to the edge of the crowd and starts to run. He's obviously worried about something.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob arrives at the coffee shop to find the police already there. His employees are standing outside, talking to the officers. Bob hurries over, his heart sinking when he sees the look on their faces. "What happened?" he asks. One of the employees, a young woman named Sarah, looks at him with tears in her eyes. "Two men came in with guns and demanded money," she says, her voice shaking. "We gave them what we had in the till, but they weren't satisfied. They made us open the safe in the back. I don't know how much money they got, but they took it all." Bob's mind is racing. He can't believe this is happening. He asks the police what they think happened. The officer tells him that it looks like a robbery gone wrong. They don't have any suspects yet, but they're working on it. Bob tells the officer that he wants to press charges. He wants these men caught and brought to justice. The officer assures him that they will do everything they can. Bob thanks him and goes back inside. He can't believe this is happening. His business has been robbed and he has no idea what to do.
