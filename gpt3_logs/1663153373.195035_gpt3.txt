Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sky is dark and filled with stars. Aleksy is standing on the surface of the moon, next to a small grocery store. It's 6pm, and the store is about to close. Aleksy is wearing a spacesuit and carrying a backpack full of groceries. He walks into the store and is greeted by the clerk, who is also wearing a spacesuit. Aleksy begins to browse the shelves, looking for something to eat. He eventually settles on a package of crackers and a bottle of water. He takes his groceries to the counter and pays for them. The clerk hands him his change and Aleksy gives her a friendly smile. He thanks her for her help and then heads back out into the lunar night.
