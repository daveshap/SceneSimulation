SCENE: Aleksy was in the middle of his night shift at the grocery store when he heard a noise coming from the dark forest outside. He went to investigate and saw a group of men carrying large sacks of what looked like cocaine. Aleksy was not sure what to do, but he knew he had to do something. He ran back to the store and called the police. When the police arrived, they apprehended the men and took them into custody. Aleksy was a hero!

The police thanked him for his help and told him that he was a hero. Aleksy could not believe it. He had never felt so alive before.
