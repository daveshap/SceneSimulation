Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi is a software engineer who works from home. It's mid-afternoon and she's just finishing up her work for the day. She's been sitting at her desk, staring at her computer screen for the past few hours, and she's starting to feel a bit drained. She gets up from her desk and stretches her arms above her head. She lets out a long sigh and rubs her tired eyes. As she does, she notices a few things around her bedroom that she hasn't noticed before. The cobwebs in the corner of the room, the dust on the dresser, the pile of clothes on the floor... she's been so busy with work lately that she's let her own personal space become a bit of a mess. Swathi decides to take a break from work and tidy up her bedroom. She starts by making her bed, then she picks up the clothes off the floor and put them away. She dusts off the dresser and the windowsill, and sweeps the floor. After a few minutes of work, her bedroom looks much better. Swathi feels better too. She's not as tired as she was before, and she's taken a small step towards taking better care of herself.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi finishes dusting her windowsill and looks around her bedroom with a satisfied feeling. She's glad she took a break from work to tidy up a bit. Suddenly, she hears her phone ringing from her desk. She walks over and sees that it's her boss calling. She answers, and her boss starts berating her for taking a break when she should be working. Swathi tries to explain that she was just taking a quick break to dust her bedroom, but her boss doesn't want to hear it. He yells at her for slacking off and tells her to get back to work. Swathi hangs up the phone, feeling upset and frustrated. She knows she shouldn't have taken a break when she's supposed to be working, but she doesn't want to let her own personal space go to waste either. She looks around her bedroom and decides that she'll tidy up a bit more later. For now, she'll just have to focus on work.
