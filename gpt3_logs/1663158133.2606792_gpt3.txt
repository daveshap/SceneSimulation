SCENE: The sun is setting over the city, casting a warm glow over the bustling streets. Aleksy is finishing up his shift at the grocery store, stocking the shelves and cleaning up after the last few customers have left. He's looking forward to finally getting home and relax after a long day. As he's closing up the store, he hears a loud crash outside. He goes to see what's going on and sees a group of teenagers, throwing rocks and graffiti-ing the store's front window. Aleksy rushes outside to try and stop them, but they take off running. He's feeling frustrated and angry as he assesses the damage. He's thankful that nobody was hurt, but he knows that it's going to cost a lot of money to fix the window. He just hopes that the insurance will cover it.
