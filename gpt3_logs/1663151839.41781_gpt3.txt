Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The alarm clock goes off, jolting Mashawn out of a deep sleep. He reaches over and smacks the snooze button before rolling out of bed. His feet hit the cold floor and he shivers as he makes his way to the bathroom. He stares at himself in the mirror and lets out a long sigh before starting the shower. The hot water feels good as he stands there, letting the sleep slowly drain out of his body. He thinks about the day ahead as he scrubs himself clean. Another day on the construction site. He's been working there for months, and he's starting to get pretty fed up with it. But he needs the money, so he'll just have to suck it up and keep going. He steps out of the shower and dries off before getting dressed. He gives himself one last look in the mirror before heading out the door. He knows it's going to be a long day.
