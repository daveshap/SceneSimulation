SCENE: It was evening, and Aleksy was getting ready to close up the grocery store for the night. He had just finished sweeping the floors and was putting the broom away when he heard a loud commotion outside. He peeked out the window and saw a group of people walking quickly down the street, heading in his direction. He quickly turned off the lights in the store and hurried to the back room, hoping they wouldn't notice him. He could hear them now, shouting and smashing things as they came closer. HeHide under the desk in the back room and waited, his heart pounding in his chest. The door to the store burst open and he could hear them walking around, smashing things and throwing things. He was terrified that they would find him, but he didn't dare move. After what seemed like forever, they finally left and he cautiously emerged from his hiding spot. The store was a mess, but luckily they hadn't found him. Aleksy sighed in relief and started to clean up the mess, trying to forget the terrifying experience.
