==========

Tom is sitting at his desk, typing away on his computer. The office is quiet, as most of the employees have already gone home for the day. Tom is finishing up his shift and is getting ready to leave. He hears a noise coming from the hallway and gets up to investigate. He sees a man walking down the hall, carrying a stack of papers. The man doesn't notice Tom and continues walking. Tom goes back to his desk and gathers his things. He turns off the lights and leaves the office, locking the door behind him.
