Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The forest is dark and eerie. The trees are tall and foreboding, and the undergrowth is dense. Swathi is a software engineer who is on a business trip to South America. She is lost and has been wandering around in the forest for hours. She is tired and scared, and her clothes are torn and muddy. She hears a noise in the distance and starts to run, but she trips and falls. She looks up and sees a large, furry creature standing over her. She screams, but it is too late. The creature has already killed her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The creature stands over Swathi's lifeless body, its furry bulk looming menacingly in the darkness. It bends down to feast on its kill, tearing into the soft flesh with sharp claws and teeth. Swathi's screams echo through the forest, unanswered and unheeded. Her blood stains the ground, a dark pool in the eerie silence.
