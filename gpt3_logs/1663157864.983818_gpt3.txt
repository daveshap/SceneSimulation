SCENE: The moon casts a pale light over the quiet beach. In the distance, the sound of waves crashing against the shore is soothing. A lone figure is walking along the beach, his shoes leaving imprints in the sand. He is Wang, a delivery driver. He has been working for the past few hours and is now on his way home. He is tired, but the thought of seeing his wife and children soon gives him strength. As he walks, he notices something shining in the sand. He bends down to pick it up, and realizes it is a piece of jewelry. He wonders who it belongs to and how it ended up here. Suddenly, he hears someone calling his name. He turns around and sees a woman running towards him. He recognizes her as his neighbor, Mrs. Chen. She seems frantic and Wang wonders what could be wrong. Mrs. Chen tells him that her daughter is missing and she has been looking for her all night. She asks Wang if he has seen her. Wang knows that the Chen family lives near the beach and he often sees their daughter playing there. He tells Mrs. Chen that he has not seen her daughter tonight, but he will help her look for her. Together, they search the beach, but there is no sign of the little girl. Wang is about to give up when he hears a sound coming from the nearby bushes. He cautiously approaches and sees the little girl hiding there. Mrs. Chen is overjoyed to see her daughter safe and Wang is relieved that he was able to help. They both go home, tired but satisfied.
