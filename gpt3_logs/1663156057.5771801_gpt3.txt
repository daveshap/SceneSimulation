Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Sandy sits on the mountaintop, watching the sun set over the picturesque European landscape. She's been here many times before, but it never fails to take her breath away. As the last rays of sunlight disappear, Sandy's thoughts turn to her children, who are at home with their father. She misses them terribly, but knows that she made the right decision when she decided to stay home and take care of them. Sandy knows that her children are in good hands, and she's confident that they'll be just fine without her.
