SCENE: Jenna is a high schooler who has come to visit the Eiffel Tower with her family. They have been walking around the city all day and are now taking a break under the famous structure. Jenna is sitting on the ground, leaning against the base of the tower. She is looking up at the sky and admiring the view. Her parents are sitting on a bench nearby, chatting with each other. Jenna's younger brother is running around, playing with a toy car.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna's mother gets up from the bench and walks over to Jenna. She sits down next to her and puts her arm around her. They sit in silence for a moment, gazing up at the Eiffel Tower. Jenna's mother then speaks, "Jenna, this is going to be a great year for you. I can feel it." Jenna smiles and nods. "I know, Mom. I can't wait to see what the future holds."
