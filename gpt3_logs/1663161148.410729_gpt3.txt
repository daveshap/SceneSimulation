LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob is moving around the coffee shop quickly, taking orders and making coffee. The customers are all enjoying their drinks and conversation. The atmosphere is busy but relaxed. Suddenly, the door bursts open and a group of armed robbers come in. Everyone in the shop freezes as the robbers start demanding money and valuables. Bob quickly hands over the money in the till and the robbers start rounding up the customers, demanding their wallets and phones. One of the robbers comes over to Bob and puts a gun to his head, demanding the keys to the back room. Bob reluctantly hands over the keys and the robbers start herding everyone into the back room. The customers are all terrified, huddled together in the back room. The robbers start ransacking the place, taking whatever they can find. After a few minutes, they seem to be satisfied and start to leave. But before they go, one of the robbers turns to Bob and says, "If you call the police, we'll be back. And next time, we'll kill you." And with that, they're gone. Bob is left standing there, shaking with fear.
