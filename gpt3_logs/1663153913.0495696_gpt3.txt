Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Jenna is walking along the quiet beach, her feet sinking into the warm sand with each step. She's been walking for hours, ever since she left her hotel room in the middle of the night. She's not sure what led her here, but she feels drawn to this place. The moon is high in the sky, casting a silver glow over the landscape. Jenna can see the waves crashing against the shore, and the occasional fish jumping out of the water. She feels peaceful here, despite the darkness. Suddenly, Jenna hears a noise behind her. She turns around, but there's nothing there. She starts to walk again, but the noise comes again, this time closer. Jennastartsto run, but whatever is following her is gaining ground. She can see a dark shape chasing her, and she knows she won't be able to outrun it. Just as the shape is about to catch her, Jenna wakes up, panting and covered in sweat. She's relieved to find that it was only a dream, but she can't shake the feeling that something is watching her.
