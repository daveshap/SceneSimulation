SCENE: Bob is sitting in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people chatting and laughing. He looks a little out of place, like he's not quite sure why he's there. He's holding a cup of coffee and looking around nervously. Suddenly, the lights dim and the concert begins. Bob is startled by the sudden change in atmosphere and looks around, wide-eyed. He watches the performers on stage for a moment, before starting to feel restless. He takes a sip of his coffee and looks around again, before getting up and leaving the concert hall.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob walks quickly out of the concert hall, Coffee cup in hand. He feels out of place and uncomfortable in the formal setting. As he walks, he takes a sip of his coffee. He starts to feel a little better as he exits the building and walks into the night air. He looks up at the stars and takes a deep breath. The fresh air feels good and he starts to relax. He takes another sip of coffee and decides to walk around the block. As he walks, he notices the sound of music coming from a nearby bar. He hesitates for a moment, before deciding to go in.
