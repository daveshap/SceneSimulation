Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Aleksy was sitting at his desk, eating his lunch and scrolling through Facebook on his phone. He saw a post about a new grocery store that was opening up down the street from his office. Aleksy was curious, so he finished his lunch and went to check it out. When he got there, he saw that the store was already pretty busy. He browsed the shelves for a bit, but didn't see anything that he wanted to buy. He did, however, see a sign for a job opening. He was interested, so he filled out an application. After he finished the application, he went back to his office. He wasn't sure if he would get the job, but he was excited at the possibility of working closer to his office.
