SCENE: Swathi enters her bedroom and immediately notices the warm, orange glow coming from the setting sun. She walks to the window and gazes out at the city skyline, admiring the way the light reflects off the glass and metal of the buildings. As she looks out, she sees the city begin to light up as the evening sets in. She watches the cars driving by and the people walking on the sidewalks below and wonders what everyone is doing and where they're going. She eventually turns away from the window and begins to get ready for bed, starting with brushing her teeth and washing her face. She then changes into her pajamas and crawls into bed, pulling the covers up to her chin. As she lies there, she begins to think about her day and what she's accomplished. She reflect on her job and how she's helped create software that people all over the world use. She feels proud of her work and grateful for her career. Eventually, she begins to feel tired and her thoughts start to drift. She begins to think about the future and what it might hold for her. She wonders if she'll find love, have children, and continue to be successful in her career. As she starts to drift off to sleep, she feels happy and content with her life.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The next morning, Swathi wakes up to the sound of her alarm. She lazily gets out of bed, feeling a bit groggy from sleep. She walks into the bathroom and starts her morning routine by brushing her teeth and washing her face. She then walks into the kitchen, where she makes herself a cup of coffee. She sits down at the kitchen table and starts to drink her coffee, scrolling through her phone. She checks her email and social media, and sees that she has a few work emails that she needs to respond to. She starts to type out responses, sipping her coffee in between. After a few minutes, she finishes her coffee and gets up from the table. She walks into her bedroom and gets dressed for work, picking out a nice blouse and a skirt. She then grab her purse and keys and head out the door, ready to start her day.
