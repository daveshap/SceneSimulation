Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is driving his truck through the darkness, his headlights cutting through the night. He's delivering a shipment of supplies to a remote village in Africa, and he knows he has to be careful. There are often bandits on these roads, looking to steal whatever they can. Wang keeps his hand on the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the road ahead. He's getting close to his destination, but he doesn't let his guard down. Suddenly, he sees movement in the bushes by the side of the road. He slows down, his heart racing. He knows he shouldn't stop, but he can't just leave someone stranded in the middle of the night. He hesitates for a moment, then decides to stop. He cautiously gets out of the truck, his hand on his gun. He approaches the bushes, and a man jumps out at him, brandishing a knife. Wang jumps back, his heart pounding. He draws his gun and fires, hitting the man in the chest. The man falls to the ground, dead. Wang stands there for a moment, his hand shaking. He knows he had no choice, but killing someone is never easy. He takes a deep breath and gets back in the truck, driving the rest of the way to his destination.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang arrives at the remote village, his truck loaded with supplies. He's relieved to have made it safely, but his relief is short-lived. He sees a group of men approaching, armed with guns. He knows he's in trouble. He tries to start the truck and drive away, but it's too late. The men are upon him, demanding money and supplies. Wang pleads with them, but they don't listen. They rough him up, taking whatever they want. They leave him there, beaten and bloody. Wang knows he's lucky to be alive. He gathers what's left of his supplies and makes his way to the village, where he'll get help.
