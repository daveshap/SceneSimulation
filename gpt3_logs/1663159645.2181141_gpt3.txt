SCENE: The concert is in full swing, and the crowd is going wild. Sandy is standing in the middle of the action, cheering and clapping along with the music. She's wearing a bright red dress and has her hair pulled back in a tight bun. She looks like she's having the time of her life. The band is playing their hearts out on stage, and Sandy is singing along with every word. She knows all the lyrics, and she's belting out the chorus at the top of her lungs. She's dancing and jumping around, and she's completely lost in the music. The concert is coming to an end, and Sandy is sad to see it go. She's been having the time of her life, and she doesn't want it to end. But she knows that she'll be back again soon.
