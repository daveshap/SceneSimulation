Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the sky. The air is still and warm, with the promise of a hot day ahead. Birds are singing in the distance, and the sounds of locusts and other insects fill the air. Sandy is sitting on her porch, enjoying the peace and quiet of the morning. She is surrounded by the mud brick walls of her home, and the thatched roof provides shade from the sun. Sandy's children are still asleep inside, and she has a few moments to herself before the start of the busy day. She sips her tea and listens to the sounds of the African bush. Suddenly, she hears a loud crashing noise in the distance. Sandy knows that sound all too well - it's the sound of an elephant. She knows that if an elephant is nearby, it's best to stay inside and wait for it to pass. Sandy quickly gathers her things and goes inside, closing the door and windows tightly. She waits quietly, listening to the elephant moving around outside. After a few minutes, she hears it moving away and she relaxes, knowing that her family is safe.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continues to rise, and the temperature begins to climb. Sandy can feel the heat emanating from the mud brick walls of her home. The thatched roof offers little relief from the growing heat, and Sandy begins to sweat. She can hear her children stirring inside, and she knows she needs to get them up and start the day. Sandy takes one last sip of her tea and heads inside. Her children are rubbing their eyes and stretching as they wake up. Sandy helps them get dressed and brush their teeth, then she sends them outside to play while she prepares breakfast. She can hear them laughing and chasing each other as they run around in the yard. Meanwhile, the elephant is still roaming around the area, and Sandy keeps a close eye on it. She knows she needs to be careful, as elephants can be dangerous. She keeps her children close by, and whenever the elephant gets too close, she shoos it away. After breakfast, Sandy gathers her children and they begin their day. They spend some time playing games and doing chores around the house. As the day goes on, the heat becomes unbearable. Sandy and her children take refuge in the shade of the porch and drink lots of water to stay cool. Eventually, the elephant moves on and Sandy and her family can go about their day as usual. The sun sets, and the cool evening air brings relief from the heat. Sandy and her children sit outside and enjoy the peace and quiet of the African bush.
