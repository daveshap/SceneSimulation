Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The scene is set in an office building, in Bob's coffee shop. It is evening, and the shop is closing for the night. Bob is putting the chairs up on the tables and sweeping the floor. He is tired from a long day of work. As he is sweeping, he hears a noise from the back of the shop. He freezes and listens. He hears something moving around in the storage room. He knows he should call the police, but he is also curious to see what is going on. He quietly sets the broom down and grabs a baseball bat from behind the counter. He creeps to the back of the shop, bat in hand. He slowly opens the door to the storage room and peers inside. He sees a figure rummaging through the boxes. He raises the bat and prepares to swing.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob slowly opens the door to the storage room and peers inside. He sees a figure rummaging through the boxes. The figure is wearing a black hoodie and has their face covered. Bob can't tell if it is a man or a woman. He raises the bat and prepares to swing. The figure hears him and turns around. Bob swings the bat, but the figure ducks and the bat hits the wall. The figure charges at Bob and tackles him to the ground. Bob drops the bat and it clatters to the floor. The figure starts to punch him in the face. Bob tries to fight back, but the figure is too strong. The figure gets up and starts to walk away. Bob is lying on the floor, beaten and bruised. He watches as the figure disappears out the door. He knows he should call the police, but he is too shaken up to move. He decides to wait until morning.
