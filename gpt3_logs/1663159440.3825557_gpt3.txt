He cleans up his tools and equipment, and then heads to the gate to clock out. As he walks through the gate, he sees the bustling city streets. The sun is just beginning to set, and the city is alive with activity. Cars are honking, people are walking and talking, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Mashawn begins to walk home, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. He smiles to himself, happy to be finished with work for the day.

==========

Mashawn is almost home from his walk, when he hears a loud commotion coming from the alleyway up ahead. He quickens his pace, but as he rounds the corner, he's met with the sight of a group of large men, attacking a smaller man. The man is trying to fight back, but he's outnumbered and outmatched. The men are laughing and jeering as they punch and kick the man. Mashawn knows he can't just stand by and watch, so he draws on all his courage and charges into the fray. He yelling and swinging his fists, trying to get the men to back off. It takes a few moments, but eventually the men leave, and Mashawn is left standing over the injured man. He helps the man to his feet and walks him to the nearest hospital.
