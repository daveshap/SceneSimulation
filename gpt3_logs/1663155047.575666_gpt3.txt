Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's the middle of the night, and Aleksy is working the graveyard shift at the local grocery store. The store is brightly lit, and Aleksy is stocking shelves and cleaning up. He's been working for a few hours, and he's starting to feel pretty tired. Suddenly, the store's alarm system goes off. Aleksy knows that this means that someone has broken into the store. He quickly grabs a broom and starts trying to defend himself. The intruder is a big, burly man, and he quickly overpowers Aleksy. He ties him up and starts ransacking the store. Aleksy is terrified, and he thinks that the man is going to kill him. The man doesn't kill Aleksy, but he does rough him up pretty badly. He leaves him tied up in a corner of the store and makes off with a bunch of merchandise. Aleksy is relieved to be alive but traumatized by the experience.
