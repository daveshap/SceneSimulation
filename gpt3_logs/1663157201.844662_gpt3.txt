Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sky is a deep, dark blue, and the sun is just starting to dip below the horizon. Aleksy is standing on the surface of the moon, next to a small grocery store. He's been working there all day, and he's just about to finish his shift. The store is mostly empty, and it's been a slow day. Aleksy is starting to get a little bit restless. He's looking forward to going home and relax. Suddenly, the door to the store opens and a customer walks in. Aleksy greets the customer and asks if he needs any help. The customer doesn't respond, and just starts browsing the shelves. Aleksy is a little bit confused, but he doesn't say anything. He just goes back to his tasks. After a few minutes, the customer comes up to the counter with a few items. Aleksy rings him up and the customer pays. As he's putting the change away, the customer speaks for the first time. "Thank you for your help," he says. "I'm just glad to finally be able to shop on the moon." Aleksy is taken aback. He had no idea that the customer was from the moon. He thanks the customer for his business and watches him leave. He's never seen a customer like that before, and he can't help but wonder what it's like to live on the moon.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy is standing in front of the grocery store, waiting for his ride home. He's still thinking about the customer from earlier, and he's starting to get curious about what it's like to live on the moon. He's never been off of Earth before, and the thought of living on another planet is starting to appeal to him. He's never been one for adventure, but he's starting to think that maybe it's time for a change. He's starting to daydream about what it would be like to live on the moon when he hears a voice behind him. "Excuse me, sir?" Aleksy turns around and sees the customer from the store. "I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with the cashier," the customer says. "It sounds like you're interested in living on the moon." Aleksy nods, and the customer continues. "I just wanted to tell you that it's an amazing place. I'm sure you would love it there." The customer says goodbye and Aleksy watches him leave. He's still not sure if he's ready for a change, but he knows that he's going to be thinking about the moon for a long time.
