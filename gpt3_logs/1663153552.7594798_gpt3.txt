Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Mashawn is trudging through the dark forest, his construction equipment weighing him down. He's been working all morning, and he's getting tired. Suddenly, he hears a noise in the distance. He stops and listens, trying to identify the sound. Is it an animal? A person? He can't tell. It's getting closer, whatever it is. He starts to feel uneasy. Suddenly, the noise is right behind him. He whirls around, heart pounding, to see a large, furry creature standing there, staring at him. It's a jaguar! Mashawn's fear turns to terror as the jaguar starts to stalk toward him. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. He's going to be killed! The jaguar is upon him now, teeth bared. Mashawn shuts his eyes, waiting for the end. But it doesn't come. He opens his eyes to see the jaguar standing there, looking at him. Then, without warning, the jaguar leaps at him, knocking him to the ground. Mashawn feels the jaguar's teeth sink into his flesh and he screams in pain. He struggles to get free, but the jaguar is too strong. Mashawn knows he's going to die. Then, suddenly, the jaguar releases him and runs off into the forest. Mashawn is bleeding badly, but he's alive. He struggles to his feet and starts to make his way back to civilization. He knows he's lucky to be alive, but he'll never forget the terror of that moment in the dark forest, when he thought he was going to die.
