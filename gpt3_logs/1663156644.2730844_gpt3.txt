SCENE: Mashawn had always enjoyed watching the sun set over the ocean. There was something about the way the light danced on the waves that always calming to him. Tonight, he was watching the sunset from a quiet beach in Asia. He had been working on a construction project in the area for the past few months and was finally able to take a few days off. As he watched the sun dip below the horizon, he felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was nice to just sit and relax, without having to worry about work or anything else. He was so lost in thought that he didn't hear someone approach from behind. "Excuse me, sir?" Mashawn turned to see a young woman standing there. She was holding a small bag in one hand and a camera in the other. "Do you mind if I take a picture of you?" she asked. Mashawn was a bit surprised, but he didn't mind. He posed for a few pictures as the woman snapped away. "Thank you so much!" she said when she was finished. "Have a nice evening." Mashawn watched her walk away before turning back to the ocean. The sun was almost completely gone now, but the waves were still glimmering in the waning light. He took a deep breath and felt his worries start to melt away. It was going to be a good night.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The young woman walked away from Mashawn, her heart pounding in her chest. She had been planning to approach him for the past week and she was so nervous that she had almost chickened out. But she had mustered up the courage and she was glad that she did. He was even more handsome in person than he was in the pictures she had seen of him online. She couldn't believe her luck when he agreed to let her take his picture. She walked quickly back to her hotel, her mind racing the entire way. She could barely contain her excitement as she rushed to edit the pictures she had just taken. She uploaded them to her website with a quick caption and then sat back to wait. It didn't take long for the page to blow up. She had only been running the website for a few months, but it was already starting to get a lot of attention. She was quickly becoming one of the most popular bloggers in Asia. And it was all thanks to Mashawn.
