Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Aleksy leaned back against the crates of oranges, taking a long drag on his cigarette. He exhaled a stream of smoke, watching idly as it drifted up towards the rafters of the grocery store. It was quiet inside, the only sound the soft rustle of the wind outside and the occasional car passing on the street. Aleksy was supposed to be stocking the shelves, but he doubted anyone would come in for at least another hour. Let them have their lunch, he thought. I'll work when they're ready to buy. He flicked the cigarette butt away and pushed himself upright, stretching his arms over his head. He heard a soft moan from the other side of the store and his eyes widened. He wasn't alone after all. Aleksy cautiously made his way around the shelves, following the sound. He found a woman lying on the floor, her skin pale and clammy. She was moaning softly and Aleksy could see that she was clutching her stomach. He knelt down beside her, asking in broken English if she was alright. The woman shook her head, her face contorting in pain. Aleksy could see that she was in labor. He didn't know what to do, but he knew he had to help. He pulled out his phone and called for an ambulance, then did his best to comfort the woman until help arrived.
