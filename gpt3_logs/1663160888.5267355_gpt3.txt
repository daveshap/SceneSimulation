SCENE: Mashawn finishes his last cigarette of the day, looking out at the quiet beach. He's been working hard all day, and is ready to relax. The sun is setting, and the sky is a beautiful orange. The waves are crashing against the shore, and the smell of salt is in the air. Mashawn breathes in deeply, and feels the stress of the day melting away. He's looking forward to a cold beer and a good night's sleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn takes a final drag of his cigarette, then flicks it into the sand. He stretches his arms up above his head, and lets out a deep sigh. It's been a long day, but he's finally finished everything he needed to do. All that's left now is to relax and enjoy the rest of the evening. He walks down to the water's edge, and dips his toes in the cool water. The sun is just about to set, and the sky is a beautiful orange. The waves are crashing against the shore, and the smell of salt is in the air. Mashawn breathes in deeply, and feels the stress of the day melting away. He's looking forward to a cold beer and a good night's sleep.
