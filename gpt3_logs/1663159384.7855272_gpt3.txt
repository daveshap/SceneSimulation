Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The office building is quiet at dusk, as most of the employees have gone home for the day. Bob, the coffee shop owner, is still here, cleaning up after a long day of work. He's exhausted, but he still has a few more things to do before he can go home. He finishes up wiping down the counters and mopping the floor, then he starts to turn off the lights. As he's flipping the switch for the last light, he hears a noise coming from the back room. He freezes, listening carefully. There it is again! Someone is definitely in the back room! Bob slowly grabs a baseball bat from under the counter and starts to creep towards the back room. He heart is pounding in his chest as he wonders what he's going to find. As he gets closer, he hears the noise again. It sounds like someone is rummaging through the storage room. Bob takes a deep breath and bursts into the room, swinging the bat. "Who's there?!" he shouts. To his surprise, he finds a small child, no more than 10 years old, standing in the middle of the room. The child is holding a bag of chips and looks up at Bob with wide eyes. "I'm sorry!" the child says, dropping the bag of chips. "I was just hungry." Bob lowers the bat, his heart still racing. He can't believe what he's just found. A small child, all alone in the office building, rummaging through the storage room for food. Bob looks at the child, feeling a sudden surge of compassion. He can't just leave this child here alone. He has to help. "It's okay," Bob says, taking a step closer. "I'm not going to hurt you. Come with me, and I'll get you something to eat." The child nods, and Bob takes them by the hand, leading them out of the office building. He knows he's going to have to find a way to help this child, but he doesn't know where to start.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob leads the child out of the office building and into the coffee shop. He seats them at a table and goes to the back to get them a sandwich and a drink. As he's fixing the sandwich, he can't help but wonder how the child ended up in the office building all alone. He decides he'll ask them when he brings the food out. He puts the sandwich and drink on a tray and takes it to the child's table. "Here you go," he says, setting the tray down. "I'm Bob, by the way. What's your name?" The child takes a bite of the sandwich and looks up at Bob. "My name is Timmy," he says. "I'm sorry for stealing your chips. I was just really hungry." "It's okay, Timmy," Bob says. "I'm just glad I was here to help. Now, why don't you tell me what you're doing here all alone? Do you have a family nearby?" Timmy shakes his head. "My mom died a few months ago, and my dad can't take care of me. He's always working, and I'm all alone at home. I got scared one day and ran away. I've been living on the streets ever since." Bob's heart sinks as he listens to Timmy's story. He can't imagine what it would be like to be a child, all alone and scared, trying to survive on the streets. "Well, Timmy, you don't have to worry anymore," Bob says. "You can stay here with me. I'll take care of you." Timmy's eyes light up, and he smiles. "Thank you, Bob," he says. "I'm so happy I found you."
