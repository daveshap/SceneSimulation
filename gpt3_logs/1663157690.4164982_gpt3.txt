LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy is walking along the quiet beach, enjoying the early morning air. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the waves are crashing gently against the shore. She stops to watch the seagulls for a moment before continuing on her walk. The sand is cool and refreshing under her feet as she walks, and she can see the fish swimming in the waves. The salty smell of the ocean is in the air, and Sandy can hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.
