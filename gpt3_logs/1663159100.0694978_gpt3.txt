Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun beats down mercilessly on the dusty plains of Africa. In the distance, a lone figure can be seen trudging along, weighed down by a heavy load. This is Wang, a delivery driver, who is making his way to the next village. Wang has been walking for hours, and he is beginning to tire. The heat and the weight of the package he is carrying are taking their toll. He takes a brief break to rest in the shade of a tree. He drinks some water from his canteen and eats a little of the food he has with him. After a short rest, Wang begins walking again. He knows he cannot stop for long, as he has to make the delivery before nightfall. He passes through the village and heads out into the wilderness again. As the sun begins to set, Wang finally arrives at his destination. He is met by the village elder, who takes the package from him. Wang is relieved to have made the delivery safely. He thanks the elder and begins the long walk back to the village.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang trudges back through the village, his strength depleted from the long journey. He is glad to have made the delivery safely, but he is exhausted. He stops at the village well to drink and refill his canteen. He eats a little more of the food he has with him. He sits for a few minutes to rest, but he knows he must keep moving. He stands and starts walking again. He makes his way through the village and out into the wilderness. He walks for several hours, stopping only briefly to rest and drink. Finally, he sees the lights of the village in the distance. He knows he is almost home. He quickens his pace, eager to get back to his family. He arrives at his home, weary but safe. He is greeted by his wife and children. They help him inside and give him something to eat and drink. He is happy to be home and safe with his family.
