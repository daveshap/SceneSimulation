Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Tom was walking through the forest, carrying a bag of groceries. He had been visiting his family in South America and was on his way back to the airport. It was a dark night, and Tom was having a hard time seeing where he was going. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the trees. He stopped and listened, but he couldn't tell what it was. Tom started to feel a little scared, so he picked up his pace. Then he heard the noise again, and this time it sounded like it was following him. Tom started to run, but he was tackled from behind. He hit his head on a tree and everything went black.
