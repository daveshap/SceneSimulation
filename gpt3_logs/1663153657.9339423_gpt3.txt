==========

The forest is dark and eerie. The trees are tall and foreboding, and the undergrowth is dense. Swathi is a software engineer who is on a business trip to South America. She is lost and has been wandering around in the forest for hours. She is tired and scared, and her clothes are torn and muddy. She hears a noise in the distance and starts to run, but she trips and falls. She looks up and sees a large, furry creature standing over her. She screams, but it is too late. The creature has already killed her.
