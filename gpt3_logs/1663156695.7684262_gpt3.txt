Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob stood at the edge of the mountaintop, gazing out at the vast landscape before him. The moonlight cast a eerie glow over the scene, and Bob could just make out the outline of the mountains in the distance. A cold wind blew through the air, and Bob wrapped his coat tightly around himself. He had always wanted to see the Alps, and now he was finally here. Bob had arrived in Europe a few days ago, and he had been exploring the area ever since. He had visited a few small towns and villages, but this was the first time he had ventured into the mountains. He had seen pictures of the Alps before, but they didn't do them justice. The real thing was so much more impressive. Bob was about to turn and head back to his hotel when he heard a noise behind him. He spun around, but there was nothing there. The wind must have blown a branch or something, he thought. But then he heard the noise again, and this time he was sure it was coming from the other side of the mountain. Bob started to feel uneasy. He knew he shouldn't be out here in the middle of the night by himself. But he was curious to see what was making the noise. Bob carefully made his way down the side of the mountain, using his hands to help him balance. He was getting closer and closer to the noise, and he was starting to get a bad feeling about it. Finally, Bob came to a small clearing and saw what was making the noise. There was a large, furry creature standing in the middle of the clearing, and it was making a strange noise. Bob had never seen anything like it before. The creature suddenly noticed Bob, and it let out a loud roar. Bob was so startled that he fell backwards, tumbling down the side of the mountain. He hit his head on a rock and everything went black.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob slowly opens his eyes, trying to make sense of the scene around him. He's disoriented and confused, and it takes him a moment to realize he's lying at the bottom of the mountain. Bob tries to get up, but he's in a lot of pain. He looks around and sees the creature standing a few feet away from him, still making that strange noise. Bob's heart starts to race as he realizes he's in serious trouble. The creature starts to move closer to him, and Bob starts to crawl away. But he's in too much pain and he can't move very fast. The creature is getting closer and closer, and Bob knows he's not going to make it. He's about to give up when he hears someone calling his name. He looks up and sees a group of people standing at the edge of the clearing. They've obviously seen the creature and they're trying to get Bob's attention. Bob tries to cry out to them, but he's too weak. The creature is almost on top of him now, and Bob knows he's going to die. But then he hears a gunshot and the creature falls to the ground, dead. Bob's rescuers rush to his side and help him up. They've killed the creature, but Bob will never forget what he's seen.
