He's been working hard at his coffee shop all day and it feels good to just relax and enjoy the quiet. Suddenly, Bob hears a loud noise coming from the direction of the forest. It sounds like someone is running and crying for help. Bob jumps up from his chair and runs towards the noise. As he gets closer, he can see a young woman, frantic and out of breath, running towards him. She's being chased by a large, scary-looking man with a knife. Bob doesn't hesitate. He runs towards the man and tackles him to the ground. The woman is safe now and Bob has saved her life.
