SCENE: The sun is setting on the quiet beach, and Aleksy is taking a well-deserved break from his job at the grocery store. He's been working all day, and he's exhausted, but the peaceful setting and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore is helping him to relax. He's lying on his back, eyes closed, soaking up the last of the day's warmth. Suddenly, he hears a noise that startles him. He opens his eyes and sees a figure walking towards him. As the figure gets closer, Aleksy realizes that it's a woman. She's wearing a flowing white dress that looks like it's made of silk, and her long dark hair is blowing in the breeze. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. The woman comes to a stop next to Aleksy, and she looks down at him with a gentle smile. "Hello," she says in a soft voice. "I'm sorry if I disturbed you." "It's okay," Aleksy replies, his heart racing. "I was just enjoying the sunset." The woman nods. "It is beautiful, isn't it? I love watching the sun set over the ocean." Aleksy nods, too lost in the woman's beauty to say anything else. After a few moments, the woman speaks again. "My name is Lily. What's your name?" "Aleksy," he replies. Lily smiles. "It's nice to meet you, Aleksy. I hope you have a nice evening." With that, she turns and walks away, leaving Aleksy alone on the beach, wondering if he's just dreaming.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy can't take his eyes off the woman as she walks away. He's never seen anyone so beautiful, and he can't believe she was just talking to him. He lies back down and looks up at the sky, trying to calm his racing heart. He's sure he must be dreaming, but it was the most realistic dream he's ever had. He can still see Lily's face in his mind, and he can't wait to see her again. He closes his eyes and imagines what it would be like to kiss her. He can feel her soft lips on his, and the dream is so real that he can almost taste her. Suddenly, he feels someone's hand on his shoulder, and he jumps. He opens his eyes and sees Lily standing over him, smiling. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you," she says. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You looked like you were having a nightmare." Aleksy shakes his head. "It wasn't a nightmare. It was the best dream I've ever had." Lily smiles and extends her hand to help him up. "Come on," she says. "Let's go for a walk." Aleksy takes her hand, and they start walking down the beach. He can't believe this is really happening. It feels like a dream, but he knows it's real. He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure that Lily is the woman he's been looking for.
