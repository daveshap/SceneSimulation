He got up to see what was going on and saw that a large chandelier had fallen from the ceiling and smashed onto the floor. People were screaming and running around in a panic. Tom quickly ran down the stairs to see if he could help. He saw that there were several people injured, and he started to help them to safety.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom quickly ran down the stairs to see if he could help. He saw that there were several people injured, and he started to help them to safety. One man was bleeding profusely from a large gash on his forehead, so Tom ripped off a piece of his shirt and pressed it firmly against the man's wound to try and stop the bleeding. He helped another woman who was clutching her arm in pain to a nearby chair, and he rushed to find some first aid supplies. He found a first aid kit and started bandaging up the woman's arm. He could hear people screaming and crying all around him, and he felt a sense of panic rising up inside of him. He tried to stay calm and focus on helping the people who were injured.
