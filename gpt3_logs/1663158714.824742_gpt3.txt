SCENE: Aleksy had always wanted to see the Eifel Tower. It was one of the most iconic structures in the world, and it was right there in his city. So when he got off work from the grocery store late one night, he decided to take a walk over to it. The streets were mostly empty at this time of night, and Aleksy felt a bit nervous as he made his way towards the tower. But as he got closer, he started to feel more excited. And when he finally arrived at the base of the tower, he couldn't help but stare up at it in awe. It was even more impressive up close than he had ever imagined. He stood there for a few minutes, just taking it all in, before he finally decided to head back home. But as he turned to go, he heard a noise coming from one of the alleyways nearby. He hesitated for a moment, not sure whether he should investigate or not. But then he thought, if there's someone in trouble, I should help. So he cautiously made his way towards the alley. As he got closer, he could see that there was a group of men standing there. And they didn't look friendly. He was about to turn and run the other way when one of the men spotted him. "Hey, you! Come here!" Aleksy had no choice but to go towards them. As he got closer, he could see that they were holding someone captive. A young woman was standing there, looking terrified. The men started to jeer and catcall Aleksy as he approached. They were clearly drunk, and he could see that they were about to start harassing the woman. He knew he had to do something. But he was so outnumbered and outmatched. He didn't know how he was going to get them to stop.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he approached the group of men. He could see that they were holding a young woman captive, and he knew he had to do something to stop them. But he was so outnumbered and outmatched. He didn't know how he was going to get them to stop. He could see the fear in the woman's eyes, and he knew he had to act fast. He didn't want to get hurt, but he couldn't just leave her there. He had to do something. He took a deep breath and steeled himself for what he was about to do. He charged towards the group of men, yelling at the top of his lungs. He caught them off guard, and they started to back away from him. He grabbed the woman and pulled her away from them, and then he started to run. He could hear the men yelling and cursing after him, but he didn't stop. He ran as fast as he could until he finally lost them. He stopped to catch his breath, and he could see the fear in the woman's eyes. She was shaking, and she looked like she was about to faint. He put his arm around her to steady her, and then he started to lead her away from the alley. He didn't know what he was going to do, but he had to get her to safety.
