Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Gabbi is sitting on the porch of a small hut, minding a group of small children. It is a hot day, and the children are running around and playing games to stay cool. Gabbi is fanning herself with a piece of cardboard, and occasionally spritzing the children with a water bottle to keep them from getting too sweaty. lunch time is always a busy time for Gabbi. She has to watch the children, make sure they stay out of the sun, and stop them from fighting with each other. But she doesn't mind, because she loves children. And besides, it's not like she has anything else to do. Gabbi grew up in this small village in Africa. She never went to school, and her parents could not afford to send her away to get an education. So instead, she started working as a babysitter when she was just a teenager. It's not the most glamorous job, but it's honest work, and Gabbi is good at it. The children are starting to get restless, so Gabbi stands up and starts to lead them in a game of tag. She knows that if she can tire them out now, they'll be more likely to take a nap later. And she can use the break to catch up on her own rest.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The children are getting tired, and Gabbi knows it's time to start winding down the game of tag. She starts to count to ten, and the children start to run back to the porch of the hut. Gabbi follows more slowly, her arms and legs aching from the heat and the exertion. Once they're all on the porch, Gabbi sits down in her chair and starts to fan herself again. The children are still full of energy, but they're starting to get drowsy. Gabbi sprays them with the water bottle one last time, and then starts to tell them a story. It's a story about a young girl who goes on an adventure, and it's one of Gabbi's favorites. The children listen quietly, their eyes drooping. And before long, they're all fast asleep. Gabbi smiles and gets up from her chair. She knows she'll have to wake them up soon, but for now, she's just happy to have a few moments of peace.
