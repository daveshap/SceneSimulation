SCENE: Tom is a bartender who works the night shift at a local bar. He's just gotten off work and is now heading home for the night. It's the middle of the night, so the streets are mostly empty. Tom is walking quickly, trying to get home before the sun comes up. Suddenly, Tom hears a noise coming from a nearby alley. He freezes, unsure of what to do. After a few moments of indecision, he decides to investigate. Tom cautiously enters the alley, and is immediately attacked by a crazed homeless man. The man starts swinging wildly, and Tom does his best to defend himself. After a few moments, Tom is able to subdue the man and tie him up. Tom is relieved that the ordeal is over, but is now worried that the man might have been sick. He decides to call 911 and wait for the police to arrive.
