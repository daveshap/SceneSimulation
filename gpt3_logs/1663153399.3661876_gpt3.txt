Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's a dark and moonless night, and Gabbi is all alone up on the moon. She's been tasked with babysitting the lunar base for the night, and she's feeling a bit nervous. She's never been all the way up here by herself before, and the dark shadows of the craters and mountains are a bit unnerving. Every now and then she thinks she sees something moving out of the corner of her eye, but when she turns to look there's nothing there. She's trying to stay brave, but she can't help but jump at every little noise. She's glad when her shift is finally over and she can hand the base over to the next babysitter. She's never been so relieved to see the sun come up.
