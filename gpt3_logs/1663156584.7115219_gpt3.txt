Tom is busy making drinks and chatting with the customers. The pub is a popular stop for travellers passing through and it's always busy. As Tom is serving drinks, he notices a group of men walk in and take a seat at the bar. They look like they're up to no good and Tom keeps an eye on them. Suddenly, one of the men gets up and pulls out a gun. He points it at Tom and demands all the money in the till. Tom is terrified and does as he's told. He hands over all the cash in the till and the man walks out of the pub with his buddies. Tom is shaken up but relieved that no one was hurt. He's been working at this pub for years and has never been robbed before. This was a scary ordeal for Tom but luckily it all worked out in the end.
