SCENE: Aleksy is a grocery store clerk who is working the evening shift. He is restocking the shelves with fresh produce when he notices a commotion outside the store. He sees a group of people gathering around a man who is shouting and waving his arms. Aleksy is curious to see what is going on, so he sets down the produce and goes to investigate. As he gets closer, he can hear the man screaming about how the government is lying to them and how they are all going to die. The man is sweating and his face is red with fury. The crowd around him is starting to get agitated, and some people are starting to shout back at the man. Aleksy can sense that the situation is getting out of control and he starts to back away. Suddenly, the man pulls out a gun and starts firing into the crowd. People start screaming and running in all directions. Aleksy is frozen in terror as he watches the man methodically shoot people who are trying to flee. After a few minutes, the man is the only one left standing. He looks around at the carnage he has caused, and then he turns and walks away calmly. Aleksy is still in shock as he tries to process what he has just witnessed. He can hear the sound of sirens in the distance, and he knows that the police will be arriving soon. He feels like he should do something, but he is too shaken to move. He can only stand there and stare at the bodies of the people who were killed. This is a nightmare that he knows he will never forget.
