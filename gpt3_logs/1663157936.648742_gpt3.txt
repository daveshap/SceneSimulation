Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The air is still and dusty, the only sound that of Sandy's own breathing in her space suit. She slowly makes her way across the lunar landscape, her bulky suit and oversized backpack making it difficult to move gracefully. In the distance, she can see the Earth, a bright and beautiful blue-green sphere hanging in the inky blackness of space. Sandy is on a nature walk, something she likes to do in her free time. She enjoys the peace and solitude of being on the moon, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life back on Earth. As she walks, she looks for interesting rocks and craters to explore. Tonight, Sandy has a special treat in store: she's going to watch the Earth rise. She knows that from her vantage point on the moon, she'll be able to see the Earth slowly crawl up over the horizon, a beautiful sight that never fails to fill her with wonder. She finds a good spot to set up her tripod and camera, and settles down to wait. As she watches, the Earth slowly rises, the blue-green of the oceans and continents coming into view. The sight is breathtaking, and Sandy can't help but feeling a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of our planet.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy continues to watch the Earth rise, feeling both awe and wonder at the sight. She's never tired of seeing it, no matter how many times she's done it. She snaps a few pictures, wanting to capture the moment and share it with her friends back home. After a while, she starts to feel tired, and decides to head back to her base. She carefully packs up her camera and tripod, and starts the long walk back. The air is still and dusty, and Sandy can feel her heart pounding in her chest as she walks. She knows she needs to take it slow and steady in her space suit, but she can't help but feel a sense of urgency. Finally, she reaches her base and takes off her space suit. She's relieved to be back in the air-conditioned comfort of her home, and immediately sits down to download her pictures and share them with her friends.
