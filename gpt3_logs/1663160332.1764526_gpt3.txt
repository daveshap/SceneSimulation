SCENE: As Gabbi walks through the dark forest, she hears the sound of something following her. She quickens her pace, but the thing seems to be keeping up with her. She starts to run, but she trips on a tree root and falls to the ground. The thing catches up to her and she screames as it attacks her...

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi scrambles to her feet, heart pounding in her chest. She darts a glance over her shoulder and sees the shadowy figure gaining on her. She pumps her legs harder, but her lungs are burning and she can't seem to shake the creature. Suddenly, she trips on a tree root and goes crashing to the ground. The thing is upon her in an instant, screeching and clawing at her. Gabbi screams in terror as she tries to fight it off. Just when she thinks she's about to die, a bright light blinds her and she feels herself being lifted off the ground. She's floating high above the forest now, and she can see the creature still snarling and reaching for her. Then she's moving even faster, faster than she's ever moved before. The wind whips through her hair and she feels like she's flying. Suddenly, she's back in her own bedroom, safe and sound. She looks around, bewildered, trying to figure out what just happened. Was it all a dream?
