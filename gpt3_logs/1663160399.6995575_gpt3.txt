Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a dark and moonless night, and Gabbi is all alone up on the moon. She's been tasked with babysitting the lunar base for the night, and she's feeling a bit nervous. She's never been all the way up here by herself before, and the dark shadows of the craters and mountains are a bit unnerving. Every now and then she thinks she sees something moving out of the corner of her eye, but when she turns to look there's nothing there. She's trying to stay brave, but she can't help but jump at every little noise. She's glad when her shift is finally over and she can hand the base over to the next babysitter. She's never been so relieved to see the sun come up.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun slowly rises over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the lunar landscape. Gabbi watches as the shadows start to fade away, and she begins to feel a bit better. She's still a bit jumpy, but she's glad to see the light of day. She spends the rest of her shift going over the data from the previous day and making sure everything is in order. She's glad when her relief arrives and she can finally take a break. She stretches her arms and legs and takes a deep breath of relief. It's been a long night, but she's glad it's over.
