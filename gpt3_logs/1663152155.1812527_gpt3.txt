Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Gabbi is in her charge's bedroom, straightening up some of the toys that are strewn about. She is humming to herself as she works when she suddenly hears a small noise from the closet. She freezes, listening carefully, but hears nothing else. After a moment's hesitation, she decides to investigate. She crosses the room to the closet and slowly opens the door. Peeking inside, she doesn't see anything at first. But then she notices a small form huddled in the corner, trying to make itself as small as possible. It's a little girl, who must have been hiding in the closet the whole time. Gabbi kneels down so she's at the child's level and asks her what she's doing in there. The girl just looks at her with big, scared eyes and doesn't say a word. Gabbi tries to reassure her that she's not in trouble, but the child still doesn't speak. Finally, Gabbi picks her up and carries her out of the closet. She sits down on the bed with the girl in her lap and strokes her hair soothingly. After a few minutes, the child begins to relax and falls asleep.
