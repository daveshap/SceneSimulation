Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Sandy enters her bedroom and looks around. The room is tidy, but there are toys scattered on the floor and clothes thrown over a chair. She sighs and begins to pick up the toys. As she bends down to pick up a doll, she notices a book wedged under the bed. She crawls under the bed to retrieve it and dusts it off. The book is old and worn, but the title is still legible: "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." She smiles and opens the book. Sandy begins to read the book, but she is soon interrupted by the sound of her young son crying. She puts the book down and goes to comfort him.
