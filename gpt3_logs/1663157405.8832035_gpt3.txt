SCENE: Wang is driving his truck through a dark forest in South America. He is getting close to his destination, but he is having a hard time seeing the road ahead of him. It is getting dark, and the headlights of his truck are not doing a good job of lighting up the way. Suddenly, Wang sees a figure in the road ahead of him. He slams on the brakes, but it is too late. He hits the figure, and it falls to the ground. Wang jumps out of his truck to see what he has hit. It is a young woman. She is lying on the ground, not moving. Wang can see that she is badly injured. He knows that he needs to get help for her, but he is not sure what to do. He decides to try to call for help on his cell phone. But when he tries to make a call, he gets no signal. He is in a remote area of the forest, and there is no way to get help. Wang knows that the woman is going to die if he does not do something. He makes a decision. He picks her up and puts her in the back of his truck. He will take her to the nearest town and get help for her. Wang drives as fast as he can through the dark forest. He finally arrives in the town. He takes the woman to the local hospital and gets her the help she needs. The woman survives, and Wang is hailed as a hero.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang arrives at the hospital with the injured woman. He rushes her inside and up to the front desk. The receptionist takes one look at the woman and starts to buzz for a doctor. Wang sets the woman down in a chair and steps back. He can see that she is still breathing, but she is not conscious. He knows that she needs medical help quickly. A doctor comes rushing out from the back. She takes one look at the woman and starts barking orders. She asks Wang what happened. Wang quickly tells her everything. The doctor nods and starts to examine the woman. She orders a few nurses to come and help her. They quickly wheel the woman back to the operating room. Wang is left alone in the waiting room. He sinks down into a chair and puts his head in his hands. He knows that the woman is going to need surgery, and he hopes that she will be okay. He waits for what seems like hours. Finally, the doctor comes back out. She tells Wang that the woman is going to be okay. She has a few broken bones and a concussion, but she will recover. Wang is relieved. The doctor thanks him for bringing the woman in and tells him that he is a hero.
