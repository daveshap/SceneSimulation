SCENE: Aleksy climbs up the Eiffel Tower, his heart pounding in his chest. He's never been so high up before, and the view is breathtaking. He can see the whole city stretched out below him, the lights twinkling in the darkness. He feels a sudden gust of wind and hangs on tight, his heart in his throat. But then he looks up and sees the moon shining overhead, and he feels a sudden sense of calm. He's never felt so alive before. He stays up there for hours, just staring at the view and soaking it all in. He's finally found a place where he feels truly free.
