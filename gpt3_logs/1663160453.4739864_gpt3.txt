Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The forest is eerily quiet as Bob makes his way through the trees. He has been walking for hours and is now quite lost. His only hope is to find his way back to the coffee shop where he left his phone. He knows his wife will be worried about him. Suddenly, Bob hears a branch snap behind him. He whips around, heart pounding, but there is nothing there. He is sure he is being watched but can't see anything in the dense foliage. He starts to walk again, faster this time, but the feeling of being followed persists. His heart is racing now and he is having trouble catching his breath. He breaks into a run, but whatever is following him is keeping pace. Bob can hear heavy footfalls now and something crashing through the underbrush behind him. He is about to be caught. He stumbles and falls to the ground as whatever is chasing him catches up. Bob looks up to see a large, furry creature standing over him. It is a chimpanzee, and it looks angry. Bob is terrified as the chimpanzee snatches him up in its powerful arms and begins to drag him deeper into the forest.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The chimpanzee drags Bob through the forest, stopping occasionally to hurl him against a tree or bash his head against a rock. Bob is battered and bloody, and he knows he is going to die. The chimpanzee finally stops in a clearing and drops Bob's lifeless body to the ground. It then starts to Forage through Bob's pockets, looking for food. It finds a granola bar and starts to eat it, then notices Bob's phone. It picks up the phone and looks at it for a moment before chucking it into the bushes. The chimpanzee finishes the granola bar and then calmly walks away, leaving Bob's mangled body behind.
