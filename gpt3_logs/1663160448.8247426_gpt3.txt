Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It was a cold, clear day on the mountaintop. Jenna had been hiking for hours, and she was finally nearing the top. She could see the sun beginning to set, and the view was breathtaking. As she reached the summit, she saw a small cabin perched on the edge of a cliff. It looked abandoned, but she decided to check it out anyway. The door was unlocked, and she stepped inside. It was musty and dusty, but it appeared to be unused. She explored the small cabin, and eventually made her way to the bedroom. There was a small bed in the corner, and a window overlooking the valley below. Jenna sat down on the bed and watched the sun set. It was a beautiful sight, and she felt at peace.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna woke up the next morning to the sound of birds chirping outside the window. The sun was shining, and the view was just as breathtaking as the day before. She got out of bed and stretched, then made her way outside. She exploring the area around the cabin, and found a small stream nearby. She followed the stream until she came to a small waterfall. The water was cold, but it felt good on her skin. She sat down on a rock and watched the water for a while, then decided to head back to the cabin. When Jenna got back to the cabin, she made a fire in the fireplace and started to cook breakfast. As she was cooking, she heard a noise outside. She went to the window and saw a bear wandering around the area. She watched it for a while, then went back to cooking breakfast. After she ate, she packed her things and started to head back down the mountain.
