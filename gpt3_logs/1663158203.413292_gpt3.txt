SCENE: Aleksy was in his bedroom in the middle of the night. He was awake, but he was not moving. He was just lying in his bed, staring at the ceiling. He was thinking about his life and how things were going. He was not happy with how things were going. He felt like he was stuck in a rut. He was working a dead-end job at a grocery store and he didn't have any prospects for the future. He was in his early twenties and he felt like he had wasted his life so far. He was unsure of what to do next, but he knew that he needed to make a change.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy got out of bed and went to his window. He looked out at the cityscape and sighed. He felt like he was trapped in his life and he didn't know how to get out. He was considering just leaving everything behind and starting over somewhere new. He had always wanted to travel, but he never had the opportunity. He didn't have any money saved up, but he could get a loan and then just pay it back over time. He could sell all of his belongings and use that money to help fund his trip. He was getting more and more excited about the idea the more he thought about it. He decided that he would leave in the morning and just start walking. He would figure out the rest as he went.
