Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is sitting on the edge of a crater, eating his lunch and enjoying the view. He's wearing a spacesuit and helmet, and is surrounded by the desolate, airless landscape of the moon. In the distance, he can see the Earth, a bright blue and green orb hanging in the blackness of space. He's been working on the lunar base for the past year, and he's looking forward to going home soon. But for now, he's content to sit in the silence and enjoy the peace of being alone on the moon.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn finishes his lunch and climbs to his feet, dusting off his spacesuit. He gazes out at the vast, empty landscape stretching out before him. In the distance, he can see the Earth, a bright blue and green orb hanging in the blackness of space. He feels a sudden urge to explore, and so he starts walking, his boots sinking into the soft dust with each step. He wanders for hours, admiring the strange, otherworldly beauty of the moon. The silent landscape is like a painting, and Mashawn feels like he's the only person in the world. As the sun starts to dip below the horizon, he turns back towards the base. He knows he should head back before it gets dark, but he can't help but feel a sense of wonder at the place he's been lucky enough to call home for the past year.
