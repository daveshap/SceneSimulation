Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The Eiffel Tower stands tall and imposing against the darkening sky, its metal frame outlined in twinkling lights. Bob, the coffee shop owner, is busy wiping down tables and chairs, getting ready to close up for the night. He hums to himself as he works, pausing now and then to admire the view. As dusk settles in, Bob flips the sign on the door to 'Closed' and locks up. He gives the place one last sweeping glance, making sure everything is in its place, before heading off into the night.
