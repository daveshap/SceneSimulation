Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Mashawn is walking through the dark forest, his construction worker's hat providing little light. He is trying to find his way back to the camp site. It is getting dark and he is starting to feel lost. He hears something in the distance and starts to run. He is running towards the noise, which is getting louder and closer. He can see a light up ahead and thinks he has found his way back. As he gets closer, he realizes that the light is coming from a campfire. He can see people around the fire, and they are all looking at him. He starts to feel uneasy and decides to turn back the way he came. As he turns, he sees a large animal standing in his path. It is a jaguar, and it is looking right at him.
