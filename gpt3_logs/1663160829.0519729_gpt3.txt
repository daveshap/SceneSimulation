SCENE: Jenna was walking through the forest, listening to the sounds of the animals and the crunch of leaves under her feet. It was getting dark, and she knew she needed to find a place to camp for the night. She had seen some caves earlier in the day and decided to head back in that direction. As she approached the caves, she could hear strange noises coming from inside. It sounded like someone was crying. Jenna didn't want to go in, but she felt like she had to. She slowly made her way into the cave, calling out to whoever was there. When she entered the main chamber of the cave, she saw a girl huddled in the corner, crying. Jenna went over to her and asked what was wrong. The girl, who was shaking and shaking, related her story. She said that she and her friends had been hiking in the forest when they were attacked by some men. They were tied up and brought to this cave, where the men had been keeping them captive for days. Jenna asked if the men were still there, and the girl said she didn't know, that they had been taken out earlier and hadn't come back. Jenna untied the girl and told her they were going to find a way out of the cave. She grabbed a torch from the wall and started leading the way, but she didn't get far before she heard the sound of footsteps coming towards them. Jenna panicked and tried to hide, but it was too late. The men had found them.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The men approached Jenna and the girl, their faces illuminated by the torchlight. Jenna could see the cold, callous looks in their eyes and she knew they were in trouble. One of the men grabbed the girl and shoved her towards Jenna, while the other man pulled out a knife. He held it up to Jenna's throat and ordered her to hand over the torch. Jenna did as she was ordered, her heart pounding in her chest. The man with the knife then grabbed Jenna and pulled her towards the back of the cave, while the other man took the torch and led the way. Jenna could hear the girl crying as she was led away, and she knew there was nothing she could do to help her. She was terrified and didn't know what was going to happen to her. The man with the knife pushed her into a small room at the back of the cave and ordered her to sit down. Jenna did as she was told, her mind racing. She was trying to think of a way to escape, but she was so scared she couldn't think straight. The man then tied her hands and feet and left the room, locking the door behind him. Jenna was alone in the dark, her heart pounding, waiting for the man to come back.
