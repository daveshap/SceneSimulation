Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi is walking through the dark forest, her heart hammering in her chest. She knows she's being followed, but she can't see who it is. Suddenly, a figure jumps out in front of her and she screams. The figure is wearing a mask and is holding a knife. Swathi backs away, but the figure advances on her, knives raised. She's backed up against a tree and there's nowhere to go. The figure slashes at her with the knives and she feels pain as the blade sinks into her flesh. She sinks to the ground, her vision blurring. The last thing she sees is the figure coming towards her, knives raised for the kill.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The figure comes closer, and Swathi can see that it is a woman wearing a mask. The woman raises her knives and prepares to strike, but Swathi manages to roll away just in time. She scrambled to her feet and started to run, but the woman was right behind her. She felt the sharp pain as the knives sunk into her back and she stumbled. The woman laughed as she watched Swathi fall to the ground. She came closer and prepared to strike again, but Swathi reached out and grabbed her arm. With all her strength, she shoved the woman away and ran in the opposite direction. She could hear the woman's laughter echoing through the forest as she ran, but she didn't stop. She had to get away.
