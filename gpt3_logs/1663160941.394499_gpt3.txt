SCENE: The forest is eerily quiet as Mashawn makes his way through the dense foliage. He's been working on the construction site for weeks now and is starting to get homesick. His mind wander as he thinks about his family back home and how he misses them. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap behind him. Whirling around, he draws his knife from his pocket, heart pounding in his chest. Peering into the darkness, he can't see anything. He starts to relax, thinking it was just his imagination, when a huge jaguar leaps out of the shadows and charges towards him. Mashawn barely has time to react before the jaguar is upon him, knocking him to the ground. He feels the sharp teeth sink into his flesh as he screams for help. The jaguar shakes him like a rag doll, before finally losing interest and wandering off into the jungle, leaving Mashawn bleeding and whimpering in pain.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn lay on the ground, blood oozing from his wounds. He felt lightheaded and dizzy, and everything was starting to fade to black. He could hear the jaguar prowling around in the bushes, apparently not yet satisfied with its kill. Mashawn knew he had to act fast if he wanted to survive. He tried to get to his feet, but his legs wouldn't support him. He stumbled and fell back to the ground with a groan. The jaguar heard him and came stalking out of the bushes. It approached him slowly, its eyes glittering with hunger. Mashawn knew he was done for. There was no way he could fight off the big cat. He closed his eyes and said a silent prayer, waiting for the end. Suddenly, he heard a loud screeching noise. The jaguar let out a yelp of pain and terror. Mashawn opened his eyes to see a huge bird swooping down on the cat, its talons outstretched. The bird snatched up the jaguar in its powerful claws and flew off into the sky, disappearing into the dense foliage. Mashawn lay on the ground, stunned. He couldn't believe what had just happened. He had been certain that he was going to die, but somehow he had been saved. He didn't know how to thank his mysterious savior, but he was grateful nonetheless.
