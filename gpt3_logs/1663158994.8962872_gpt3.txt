Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The dense forest canopy blocks out most of the light, making it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of Tom. He's been walking for what seems like hours, and his feet are starting to ache. He's not sure if he's going in the right direction, but he knows he needs to find help soon. Suddenly, he hears a rustling in the bushes ahead of him. He freezes, listening intently. It could be an animal, or it could be someone waiting to ambush him. He carefully reaches into his pocket and grips his knife tightly, just in case. The rustling gets closer, and Tom can see a figure moving towards him through the darkness. He relaxes slightly when he realizes it's just a small monkey. The monkey climbs up his leg and onto his shoulder, chattering away excitedly. Tom continues walking, now with the monkey as his companion. He's not sure what he's going to find in the depths of the forest, but he knows he needs to keep moving.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

As Tom continues walking, he hears the monkey chattering away excitedly on his shoulder. The sound of the monkey's voice is a welcome relief in the darkness of the forest. Tom knows he needs to keep moving, but he can't help but feel a sense of unease at the prospect of what he might find in the depths of the forest. He has no idea what he's going to find, but he knows he needs to be prepared for anything. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap in the distance. He freezes, listening intently. It could be an animal, or it could be someone waiting to ambush him. He carefully reaches into his pocket and grips his knife tightly, just in case. The branch snapping gets closer, and Tom can see a figure moving towards him through the darkness. He relaxes slightly when he realizes it's just a small deer. The deer stops in front of Tom and looks at him with its large, dark eyes. Tom feels a sense of calm wash over him. He knows he needs to keep moving, but he can't help but feel thankful for the company of the small deer.
