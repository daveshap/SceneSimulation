Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is a stay-at-home mom who is currently in her husband's office building. It is evening time and the building is mostly empty. Sandy is feeling a bit lost and confused as she is not used to being in such an environment. She is slowly making her way down the hall, looking at the various doors and businesses that are located inside the building. She is unsure of where she is supposed to go or what she is supposed to do. As she is walking, she hears a noise coming from one of the offices. She slowly approaches the door and peeks inside. She sees a man inside, pacing back and forth. It looks like he is on the phone and seems to be in the middle of a heated argument. Sandy is not sure what to do, so she just stands there and watches the man.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The man inside the office is still on the phone and seems to be getting more and more agitated. He is pacing back and forth and Sandy can see that he is getting red in the face. She is not sure what to do and is debating whether or not she should just walk away. Suddenly, the man slams the phone down on the desk and starts yelling. Sandy can hear him even though she is not sure what he is saying. She is about to walk away when the man notices her and starts walking towards the door. Sandy is frozen in place and is not sure what to do. The man walks up to her and starts to say something, but Sandy can't hear him. She just stands there with a blank look on her face.
