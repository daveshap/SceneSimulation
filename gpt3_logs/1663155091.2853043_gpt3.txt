==========

Aleksy is a grocery store clerk who is working the afternoon shift. He is restocking the shelves with fresh produce when he notices a commotion outside. He can see a large crowd of people gathering in the street and it looks like they are getting agitated. Aleksy starts to feel uneasy and decides to go and see what is going on. As he approaches the crowd, he can see that they are shouting and jeering at a group of men who are trying to cross the street. The men are obviously from a different country and they are not welcome here. The crowd starts to push and shove the men, and Aleksy can see that they are in danger. He tries to help them, but the crowd is too violent and he is forced to watch as the men are beaten and chased away. Aleksy is shaken by what he has witnessed and he can't help but feel guilty that he was unable to do more to help.
