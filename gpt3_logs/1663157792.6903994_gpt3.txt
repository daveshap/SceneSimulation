Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is high in the sky, beating down on the sand and making everything seem hazy. The waves are crashing against the shore, and a light breeze is blowing through the palms. Mashawn is sitting on the beach, eating his lunch and enjoying the view. He's been working on a construction project nearby, and he's taking a well-deserved break. He's got his feet in the water, and he's watching the people as they walk by. He's thinking about how lucky he is to be able to work in such a beautiful place.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The waves continue to crash against the shore as Mashawn finishes his lunch. He leans back against the palm tree and closes his eyes, letting the breeze cool him off. He hears the sound of someone walking towards him and opens his eyes to see a woman approaching. She's wearing a brightly colored sundress and carrying a beach towel. She smiles at him as she walks by, and he can't help but smile back. She seems like she's enjoying the day just as much as he is.
