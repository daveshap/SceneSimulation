Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy enters her bedroom and looks around. The room is tidy, but there are toys scattered on the floor and clothes thrown over a chair. She sighs and begins to pick up the toys. As she bends down to pick up a doll, she notices a book wedged under the bed. She crawls under the bed to retrieve it and dusts it off. The book is old and worn, but the title is still legible: "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." She smiles and opens the book. Sandy begins to read the book, but she is soon interrupted by the sound of her young son crying. She puts the book down and goes to comfort him.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy enters her son's room and finds him sitting in his crib, crying hysterically. She picks him up and tries to comfort him, but he continues to cry. She rocks him back and forth, and he slowly begins to calm down. She sits in the rocking chair with him and sings a lullaby. After a few minutes, he is fast asleep. Sandy gently lays him down in his crib and tiptoes out of the room.
