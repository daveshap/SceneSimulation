LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi is taken back to the first time she came to this spot. It was shortly after she'd moved to Paris, and she was feeling homesick. The city was so big and overwhelming, and she missed her family and friends back home. But standing underneath the Eiffel Tower, she suddenly felt a sense of peace. It was like the tower was giving her a big hug, and she knew she was going to be okay. Every time she's come back since, the feeling has been just as strong. Standing there now, she feels her worries melting away. The sky is a beautiful orange colour, and the tower is lit up and looks even more impressive than usual. Swathi takes a deep breath and closes her eyes, letting the moment wash over her. She feels so lucky to have found this place, and she knows it will always be her favourite spot in the city.
