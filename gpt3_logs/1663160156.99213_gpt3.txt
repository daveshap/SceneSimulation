Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is standing on the mountaintop, surrounded by darkness. She's shivering in the cold, and she can see her breath in the air. She's wearing a thin jacket, and she's starting to feel the numbing effects of the cold. She's been walking for hours, and she's exhausted. She's lost, and she has no idea where she is. She's been wandering around in the dark for what seems like forever, and she's starting to panic. Suddenly, she sees a light in the distance. It's faint, but it's definitely there. She starts walking towards it, and she soon realizes that it's a fire. There's a group of people gathered around it, and they look warm and comfortable. Jenna quickens her pace, and she soon reaches the fire. She's relieved to be out of the cold, and she's happy to see other people. She's been feeling so alone, and she's glad to have some company.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna approaches the fire and is greeted by the people sitting around it. She is offered a seat and a blanket, which she gratefully accepts. She warms her hands by the fire and looks around at the people she is now sitting with. She sees that they are all tired and dirty, like she is. They all look like they have been through a lot, and she can see the fear in their eyes. But there is also hope in their eyes, and Jenna can see that they are all fighting to survive. She feels a sense of camaraderie with these people, and she knows that they are all in this together. She looks at the fire and wonders what the future holds for them all.
