Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It is evening, and Wang, a delivery driver, enters a bedroom. He looks around the room, taking in the various items and pieces of furniture. His eyes settle on a bed in the corner of the room, and he approaches it. He picks up a pillow and sniffles it, then sets it back down. He then moves to the window and looks outside. He see the city skyline, and the many lights twinkling in the distance. He sighs and turns back to the room. He begins to unbutton his shirt, revealing a sweaty and tired body. He takes off his shirt and pants and climbs into the bed. He lets out a long sigh and closes his eyes, soon falling asleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang's eyes slowly open as the first light of day begins to filter into the room. He stretches and yawns, then climbs out of bed. He crosses to the window and looks out at the city, now awake and bustling with activity. He watches the people below for a moment, then turns back to the room. He begins to get dressed, buttoning his shirt and pulling on his pants. He puts on his shoes and heads for the door. He pauses for a moment, then looks back at the bed. He smiles to himself, then leaves the room.
