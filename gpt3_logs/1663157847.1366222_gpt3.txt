Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's lunch time, and Aleksy is up on the mountaintop enjoying the view. He's brought his lunch with him, and is sitting on a large rock enjoying the quiet. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him, and turns to see a group of goats coming up the mountain. They're followed by a woman who's herding them. Aleksy greets the woman and they start chatting. The woman tells him that she's been herding goats for years, and that it's a tough but rewarding job. She asks Aleksy what he does, and he tells her that he's a grocery store clerk. The woman is interested in hearing about Aleksy's job, and they chat for a while before she has to go back to her goats. Aleksy waves goodbye, and goes back to his lunch.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy finishes his lunch and pack up his bag. He stands up from the large rock and dusts off his pants. He takes one last look at the view before heading back down the mountain. As he walks, he thinks about the woman he just met and her interesting job. He's never thought about being a goat herder before, but it does seem like a tough but rewarding job. He wonders if he could ever do something like that. He reaches the bottom of the mountain and starts walking towards town. He has a lot to think about, and is looking forward to getting home and talking to his wife about it.
