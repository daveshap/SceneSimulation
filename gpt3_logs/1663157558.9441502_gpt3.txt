LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The lunchtime rush dies down and Tom has a moment to breathe. He looks around the bar and sees that it's starting to fill up with the after-work crowd. He sees some familiar faces, including a few regulars who always come in for a drink or two after work. The atmosphere is still festive, but there's a slightly more relaxed feeling in the air now. Tom continues to mix drinks and chat with customers. He gets to know some of the new faces, and even manages to sneak in a few jokes here and there. The bar starts to fill up more and more, and soon it's standing room only. Tom is in his element, and he can feel the energy in the room crackling. It's going to be a long, but fun, night.
