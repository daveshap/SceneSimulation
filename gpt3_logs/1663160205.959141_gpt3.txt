Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is walking through the forest, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear the sounds of the animals all around her, and she is terrified that one of them will attack her. She keeps her hand on her knife, ready to defend herself if necessary. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her and she spun around, her heart in her throat. But it's just a small animal, scurrying away into the underbrush. She exhales a sigh of relief and continues on, her heart still pounding. She has been walking for hours, and she is getting tired. She is just about to sit down and rest for a few minutes when she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like people? She starts to walk towards the noise, and as she gets closer, she can see the light of a fire. As she approaches, she can see that there are people around the fire. They are all dressed in strange clothing, and they don't look like anything she has ever seen before. She stops, not knowing what to do, and then she hears someone call her name. It's her husband, Tom. He's been missing for weeks, and she can't believe he's here. She runs to him, and they embrace each other tightly. She can't believe she's found him alive.
