Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun has just begun to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in a beautiful spectrum of oranges, pinks, and yellows. The city is slowly coming to life as people begin to stir from their homes and head to their jobs. Wang is already up and about, getting ready to start his day as a delivery driver. He loads up his van with the day's packages and sets off on his route. The streets are busy with traffic as Wang weaves in and out of lanes, making his deliveries as quickly as he can. He knows that the sooner he gets his job done, the sooner he can get home to his family. He also knows that if he doesn't hurry, he'll be stuck in traffic for hours. Wang is grateful for his job, even though it's not the most glamorous. He knows that it's not easy to find work these days, and he's thankful that he can provide for his family. He also knows that his job is important, because he's helping to keep the city running. As he makes his final delivery of the day, Wang can't help but feel a sense of pride. He's worked hard today, and he knows that he's made a difference. He can't wait to get home to his family and tell them all about his day.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang pulled up to the final address of the day, a large office building downtown. He checked the address against the package he had been delivered, then got out and headed inside. He took the elevator up to the specified floor and found the right office. He knocked on the door and waited for a moment before a frazzled-looking woman answered. She thanked him hurriedly as she took the package from him, then slammed the door shut. Wang shrugged and headed back to the elevator. He was grateful that his day was finally over. It had been a long one, and he was ready to head home to his family. He knew his wife and kids would be excited to hear about his day, and he couldn't wait to tell them all about it. He climbed into his van and started the long drive home, feeling happy and accomplished.
