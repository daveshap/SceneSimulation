Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The moon is a barren, lifeless place. The only sound is the faint hiss of Sandy's oxygen tank as she moves slowly across the dusty surface. She is wearing a bulky spacesuit and carrying a large backpack filled with supplies. It is the middle of the night, but the sunlight is still bright enough to see by. Sandy is moving cautiously, her eyes darting around for any signs of danger. She knows that there are many hazards on the moon, and she does not want to take any chances. Suddenly, Sandy hears a noise behind her. She freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. She slowly turns around, but there is nothing there. She exhales a sigh of relief and continues on her way. After a few more minutes, Sandy reaches her destination: a small crater that is her home. She climbs down into the crater and sets her backpack down. She is tired from her journey, but she is happy to be home. Sandy takes off her helmet and begins to unpack her supplies, preparing for another long night on the moon.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy is exhausted from her journey and happy to be home. She takes off her helmet and begins to unpack her supplies. She starts by taking out her sleeping bag and setting it up in the corner of the crater. Next, she takes out her food and water supplies. She is just about to start a fire when she hears a noise outside. Sandy freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. She slowly crawls to the edge of the crater and peeks over. There, she sees a large, furry creature. It is twice the size of a human and has four legs. It is covered in dust and sand, and it is making its way towards the crater. Sandy knows that she is in danger. She quickly grabs her helmet and puts it on. She grabs her backpack and runs towards the creature. She knows that she cannot outrun it, but she has to try. The creature is getting closer and closer. Sandy is about to give up when she sees a large rock ahead of her. She knows that she will not be able to outrun the creature, but she takes a chance and leaps behind the rock. The creature runs past her, and Sandy is safe. She breathes a sigh of relief and climbs out of the crater.
