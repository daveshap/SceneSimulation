Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The city is alive with energy even at this late hour. The bright lights and bustling crowds are a far cry from the quiet suburb where Gabbi lives. She feels out of place here, but she knows she has to be brave. It's her first night babysitting for the new family she's been assigned to. They live in a high-rise apartment in the heart of the city. Gabbi takes a deep breath as she steps out of the elevator onto their floor. She's met the kids before, but she's still nervous. What if they don't like her? What if she can't handle them? She takes a deep breath and knocks on the door. The mother greets her with a warm smile and Gabbi instantly feels better. The kids are already in bed, but the mother tells her they may need help to fall asleep. Gabbi nods and goes to tuck them in. She spends the next few hours reading to them and telling them stories. Eventually, they both drift off to sleep. Gabbi breathes a sigh of relief. She did it! The rest of the night is uneventful and Gabbi is able to relax and enjoy her time. She feels like she's made some new friends by the time she leaves in the morning.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi feels a sense of accomplishment as she steps out of the apartment building. She did it! She successfully babysat the two kids all night, and even managed to have some fun with them. As she walks to the subway, she replays some of the highlights of the night in her head. She remembers reading stories to them and tucking them into bed. She smiles to herself, feeling proud that she was able to handle the situation so well. Suddenly, Gabbi hears a noise coming from the alleyway to her left. She freezes, her heart racing. She told herself she wouldn't be scared, but she can't help it. She slowly backs away from the alley, her eyes darting around the empty street. She's about to turn and run when she sees a rat scurry out from the shadows. She lets out a relieved breath and laughs at herself. She's been in the city for two weeks now and she's still not used to all the noises. Gabbi continues on her way, but she can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her. She quickens her pace, but every time she turns around, there's no one there. She's starting to get freaked out, and she's glad when she finally reaches the safety of the subway station. She hops on the first train that arrives and doesn't relax until she's back in her quiet suburb.
