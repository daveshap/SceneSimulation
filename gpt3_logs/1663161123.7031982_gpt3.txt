Sandy stands atop the mountain, watching as the sun slowly rises over the horizon. She feels the fresh air fill her lungs, and the wind blowing through her hair. She feels alive and free, and can't help but smile. As she looks out over the world below her, she sees the trees and the grass, the rivers and the lakes.
