Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the gently rolling hills of the countryside, and the last of its rays are shining through the windows of the cozy cottage Swathi calls home. Inside, the young woman is curled up on the sofa with her laptop, working on the latest code for her employer. She's lost in concentration, and the only sound in the room is the soft tapping of her keyboard. Suddenly, the idyll is broken by the sound of a car pulling up outside. Swathi pauses her work, wondering who it could be at this time of day. She gets up from the sofa and goes to the window, peeking out from behind the curtains. She sees a black sedan parked in the driveway, and two men getting out of it. They're both wearing dark suits and sunglasses, and they look like they mean business. Swathi's heart sinks as she realizes they must be here for her. She quickly grabs her laptop and hides it under the cushions of the sofa, then goes to open the door. The men don't say anything as they push past her into the cottage, and Swathi's mind races as she wonders what they're going to do to her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The men don't say anything as they push past her into the cottage, and Swathi's mind races as she wonders what they're going to do to her. She backs away from them, her heart pounding in her chest, as they start to look around the room. One of them goes into the kitchen, while the other starts opening up drawers in the living room. Swathi stands frozen, not knowing what to do, as they begin to rummage through her things. She sees the man in the kitchen opening up cupboards, and she knows he's looking for her laptop. She knows she has to act fast, or they're going to find it and take it away from her. She makes a split-second decision and sprints towards the man in the living room, knocking him to the ground. She grabs her laptop from the drawer and makes a run for the door, but the other man is already blocking her path. She knows she can't outrun him, so she makes a desperate lunge for the window, smashing it with her laptop. She scrambles through the opening and runs as fast as she can away from the cottage, with the men hot on her heels. She knows she can't let them catch her, or they'll take her laptop and she'll never see it again. She runs and runs until she reaches the edge of the forest, and then she dives into the trees, hoping to lose them in the darkness.
