SCENE: The bartender, Tom, is standing behind the empty counter, looking out at the deserted lunar landscape. It's early morning, and the sun is just peeking over the horizon. The only sound is the occasional hiss of escaping air from a crack in the floor. Tom is waiting for his first customer of the day.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom looks at his watch and then out the window, seeing the sun just peeking over the horizon. He yawns and stretches his arms, looking around the empty bar. He can hear the occasional hiss of escaping air from a crack in the floor. It's been slow lately, and Tom is hoping for a busy day. He hears the sound of footsteps on the gravel outside and he smiles, walking to the door to greet his first customer of the day.
