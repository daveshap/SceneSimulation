Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is lying in bed, awake and restless. She can hear the sounds of the night outside her window - the crickets chirping, the light breeze rustling the leaves of the trees. She knows she should be sleeping, but her mind won't stop racing and she can't seem to get comfortable. She gets out of bed, quietly so as not to wake her husband and children, and goes to the window. She gazes out at the night, wondering what it would be like to be out there, under the stars, with no worries or responsibilities. She knows she can't just run away from her life, but sometimes she feels like she's going to explode if she has to stay in this house one more minute. Sandy turns away from the window and goes back to bed. She lies there for a long time, until finally she falls into a fitful sleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy tossed and turned for what felt like hours, but she knew it was probably only been a few minutes. She was exhausted, but her mind wouldn't stop racing. She felt like she was going to scream if she had to stay in this house one minute longer. She got out of bed, quietly so as not to wake her husband and children, and walked to the window. She gazed out at the night, wondering what it would be like to be out there, under the stars, with no worries or responsibilities. She knew she couldn't just run away from her life, but sometimes she felt like she was going to explode if she had to stay here. Sandy turned away from the window and went back to bed. She lay there for a long time, until finally she fell into a fitful sleep.
