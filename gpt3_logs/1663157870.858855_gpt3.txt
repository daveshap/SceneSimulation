SCENE: Mashawn is enjoying his lunch break on a beautiful mountaintop in Europe. He's surrounded by stunning views of the Alps, and he can't help but feel grateful for his job. Even though it's tough work, he loves being outdoors and feeling like he's a part of something bigger. He's just about to take a bite of his sandwich when he hears a noise behind him. He turns around to see a large, furry creature lumbering towards him. It's a bear! Mashawn knows he needs to stay calm, so he slowly backs away from the bear. The bear doesn't seem to be interested in him and soon wanders off into the woods. Mashawn is relieved but also a little shaken. He knows he's lucky that he wasn't hurt, but he'll never forget his close encounter with a real live bear!
