Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's noon, and the sun is high in the sky, casting a dappled light through the leaves of the trees. Aleksy is taking his lunch break in a small clearing in the forest. He's sitting on a fallen tree trunk, munching on a sandwich and enjoying the quiet. Suddenly, Aleksy hears a noise in the bushes. He freezes, listening intently. It sounds like someone, or something, is coming closer. Aleksy slowly reaches into his pocket for his knife, his heart pounding in his chest. The bushes part, and Aleksy finds himself face to face with a large, furry creature. It's a monkey! The monkey stares at Aleksy for a moment, then reaches out and snatches the sandwich right out of his hand. Aleksy is so surprised that he drops his knife. The monkey sits on the tree trunk and begins to eat the sandwich, watching Aleksy the whole time. Aleksy is too shocked to move. After a few moments, he slowly reaches for his knife and stands up. The monkey jumps down and runs off into the forest, disappearing from sight. Aleksy is shaking as he walks back to the grocery store. He's never seen anything like that before, and he's not sure what to make of it.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy makes his way back to the grocery store, his mind racing with what he just saw. He's never seen anything like that before, and he's not sure what to make of it. He enters the store and goes to the back room to tell his boss what happened. His boss is surprised and Aleksy can tell that he doesn't believe him. Aleksy starts to doubt himself, wondering if maybe he imagined the whole thing. But then he remembers the sandwich, and how real it felt when the monkey snatched it right out of his hand. He knows he didn't imagine it, but he still can't believe it happened. He decides to go back to the clearing to see if he can find any evidence of the monkey. He looks for footprints or any other signs that the monkey was there, but he doesn't find anything. He does find his knife, however, and he takes it as a souvenir of his strange encounter. Aleksy will never forget what happened that day, and he'll always wonder if he really did see a monkey in the forest.
