Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun is setting over the African plains, and Sandy is getting ready for her evening meal. She has been out all day collecting firewood and water, and now she is ready to relax and cook her dinner. She has a small fire going in her cooking pot, and she is adding some vegetables that she gathered from her garden. As she cooks, she hears the sound of lions roaring in the distance. She knows that they are far away, but it still makes her feel a little uneasy. After she eats her dinner, she takes a few minutes to enjoy the sunset before going to bed.
