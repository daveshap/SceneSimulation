Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow over the landscape. Tom had been up for hours already, getting the bar ready for the day. He washed glasses and polished the counter, making sure everything was just so. Now that everything was in place, he could finally sit back and relax for a bit. He leaned against the back wall of the bar, letting out a weary sigh. It had been a long night, and he was looking forward to a few hours of peace and quiet. Suddenly, the calm was broken by the sound of loud, shouting voices. Tom groaned and stepped out from behind the bar, just in time to see a group of men stumbling towards him, clearly drunk. He knew there was going to be trouble.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continued to rise, casting an ever-brightening glow over the landscape. Tom stood behind the bar, his arms crossed, as he watched the group of men approach. He could see the anger in their eyes, and he knew they were looking for a fight. The first man stepped up to the bar and slammed his fist down, demanding a drink. Tom ignored him and turned to the next man, who was already starting to swing at him. Tom ducked out of the way and grabbed the man's arm, twisting it behind his back. The man yelped in pain and Tom shoved him away, before turning to face the rest of the group. They were all shouting now, and Tom could see the violence in their eyes. He knew he was in for a long night.
