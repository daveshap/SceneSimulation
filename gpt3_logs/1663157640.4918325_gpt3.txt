Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is in her bedroom, at her desk. It is dusk, and the light is beginning to fade. She is working on a school project, and she is having trouble concentrating. She keeps looking out the window at the trees and the sky, and she can hear the sound of the leaves rustling in the breeze. She is getting restless, and she keeps emailing her friend Sarah for help. Sarah is not responding, and Jenna is getting frustrated. She gets up from her desk and goes to the window. She opens it and leans out, breathing in the fresh air. She looks up at the sky and watches the clouds drift by. She feels a sense of peace and calm come over her, and she goes back to her desk and finishes her project.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna sits at her desk, gazing out the window as the sky grows darker. She's finding it hard to focus on her homework with the pretty view distracting her. She keeps eyeing the trees and the way the leaves are rustling in the breeze. She gets an email notification and sees that it's from her friend Sarah. She's been working on this project together, but Sarah has been MIA all day. Jenna clicks to open the email and reads through Sarah's message. Sarah apologizes for not being able to help earlier and says she's been really busy. She's included a few links to websites that might be helpful. Jenna reads through the websites and starts to feel more confident about the project. She starts typing away and doesn't notice the time passing. Soon, it's dark outside and she's totally immersed in her work. She steps back from the desk to stretch her sore muscles. She feels good about the progress she's made and decides to call it a night. She closes the window and heads to bed, feeling calm and content.
