SCENE: Bob straightens the last of the chairs and steps back to survey his handiwork. His coffee shop looks inviting, with its soft lighting and comfortable chairs. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee hangs in the air, tantalizing customers as they walk by. Bob is nervous. This is his first day open for business, and he doesn't know if anyone will come. He knows there are other coffee shops in the area, but he's hopeful that his will be the one that stands out. He takes a deep breath and goes to the counter to wait for customers.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob stands behind the counter, fidgeting nervously as he awaits his first customer. He's not sure if anyone will show up, but he's hopeful that his coffee shop will be the one that stands out. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee hangs in the air, tantalizing customers as they walk by. After a few minutes, Bob sees someone walking towards the shop. As the person gets closer, he sees that it's a woman. She's carrying a large book bag and looks like she's in a hurry. She comes up to the counter and sets her book bag down with a thud. "I need a large coffee, black," she says. Bob nods and hurries to fill her order. He hands her the coffee and she gives him a quick smile before turning to leave. Just then, Bob's stomach lets out a loud growl. He realizes he's forgotten to eat breakfast. Oh well, he thinks, there's always lunch.
