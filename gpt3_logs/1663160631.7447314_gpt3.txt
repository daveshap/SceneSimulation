SCENE: It's a cold, clear night, and the Eiffel Tower looms overhead, its steel skeleton stark against the sky. Tom, a bartender, is leaning against the railing, taking a smoke break. He looks up at the tower and sighs. It's been a long night, and he's ready to go home. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He turns around and sees a woman walking towards him. She's wearing a long, flowing dress and has a scarf wrapped around her head. She looks lost. Tom: Can I help you? Woman: Yes, I'm looking for the nearest metro station. Tom: You're in luck. It's just over there. He points in the direction of the metro station and the woman thanks him. She starts to walk away, but then she stops and turns back to Tom. Woman: Can I ask you something else? Tom: Sure. Woman: What's your name? Tom: Tom. Woman: What's your story, Tom? Tom: That's a long story. I don't think you want to hear it. Woman: I do. I want to know everything about you. Tom: Why? Woman: Because I'm going to kill you. Tom: What? Woman: You heard me. I'm going to kill you. But first, I want to know everything about you. Your hopes, your dreams, your fears. I want to know it all. Tom: Why are you doing this? Woman: Because I can. Tom: Please, don't kill me. Woman: It's too late for that. Tom: No, please, I have a family. Woman: I don't care. Tom: Please, I'll do anything. Woman: Anything? Tom: Yes, anything. Woman:Alright, then. strip. Tom: What? Woman: strip. I want to see your body. Tom hesitated for a moment, but then he slowly started to remove his clothes. The woman watched him intently, a satisfied smirk on her face. Tom was now completely naked. He tried to cover himself up, but the woman just laughed. Woman: Now, Tom, let's begin.
