LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy sits in her hut, trying to get her four children to eat their dinner. The hut is made of mud and sticks, and the only light comes from a small fire in the corner. The children are tired and hungry, and Sandy is doing her best to feed them. However, there is not much food, and Sandy is worried about how she will feed her family tomorrow. Sandy looks at her children and feels a pang of guilt. She knows that she cannot keep them alive on the little amount of food that they have. She has been rationing the food as best she can, but she knows that it is not enough. Sandy looks at the fire and realizes that she has no other choice. She has to burn her hut down. It is the only way to get food for her children. Sandy takes a deep breath and stands up. She looks at her children one last time and then starts to tear down the hut. The children watch as their mother destroys their home. They do not understand what is happening, but they trust their mother. Sandy builds a large fire in the center of the hut and then adds all of the food to the fire. The children watch as their mother burns all of the food. They are confused and scared, but they do not say anything. Sandy knows that this is the only way to feed her children. She has to sacrifice her own life to give them a chance to live. Sandy sits in the fire and lets the flames consume her. The children watch as their mother burns to death. They are horrified, but they do not move. They know that they have to stay by the fire to stay alive.
