Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sky is just starting to lighten up, and the Eifel Tower looms large against the background of the Paris skyline. Sandy is standing at the base of the tower, looking up at it with a sense of wonder. She's never been to Paris before, and the sight of the tower is truly breathtaking. She can hear the sounds of the city starting to come to life all around her - cars honking, people talking, and the sound of a distant siren. The air is cold and crisp, and Sandy can see her breath in the air. She's here with her husband and two young children, who are still asleep in the hotel room. Sandy knows they'll be up soon, and she wants to make the most of this moment before the day gets started. She stands there for a few minutes, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, before heading back to the hotel to wake her family up.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy walks back to the hotel, her feet dragging a little bit. She's not used to being up so early, and she knows her family will be up soon. She knows she needs to get them up and moving, but she can't help but feel a little bit exhausted. When she gets back to the room, she finds her husband and two young children still sound asleep. She smiles and shakes her head, before heading over to the window to open the curtains. The light from outside fills the room, and Sandy can hear the sounds of the city starting to come to life all around her - cars honking, people talking, and the sound of a distant siren. The sound of the siren gets louder and Sandy realizes it's coming from right outside the hotel. She looks out the window and sees a fire truck speeding down the street, its lights flashing and its siren blaring. Sandy watches it for a moment, before turning back to her family. She knows they need to get up and start their day, but she can't help but feel a little bit shaken by what she's just seen.
