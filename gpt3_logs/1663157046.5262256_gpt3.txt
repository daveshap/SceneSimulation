Bob had been walking for hours, it seemed like days. He had been walking since he had last seen the light of day. His feet were blistered and sore, his throat was parched and dry. He had not eaten in days. He had been walking in circles for hours, it seemed like days. He had been walking since he had last seen the light of day. His feet were blistered and sore, his throat was parched and dry. He had not eaten in days. He was lost. He had been walking in circles for hours, it seemed like days. He had been walking since he had last seen the light of day. His feet were blistered and sore, his throat was parched and dry. He had not eaten in days. He was lost. He sits down on a tree stump to rest. He is exhausted. He closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep. He is woken up by a rustling in the bushes. He stands up and draws his knife. He is ready to fight. From the bushes, a small animal emerges. Bob relaxes and puts his knife away. He is relieved. He scoops up the animal and continues walking. He is hoping to find his way out of the forest soon. He walks for what seems like hours, but it is hard to tell because the sun is not visible through the thick trees. His stomach grumbles and he feels lightheaded. He knows he needs to eat soon or he will not make it much further. He sees a berry bush up ahead and relief washes over him. He quickly gathers some berries and eats them, feeling strength returning to his body. He looks around, trying to get his bearings, and realizes he is no longer sure which way he came from. He starts to panic, but then he sees a small clearing up ahead and decides to go towards it. Maybe he will be able to get a better view of his surroundings from there. As he enters the clearing, he hears a noise that sounds like someone crying. He freezes, not sure what to do. He tentatively starts to walk towards the noise, and as he gets closer he realizes it is a person. He breathes a sigh of relief and calls out, "Hello? Are you okay?" The person, a young woman, looks up at him with tear-stained cheeks. She sniffles and says, "I've been lost out here for days. I don't know where to go." Bob's heart sinks. He knows the feeling all too well. He tries to think of a way to help her, but he is just as lost as she is. Then he has an idea. "Maybe we can help each other," he says. "If we both keep walking, maybe we will find a way out of here." The woman nods and they start walking together. They walk for hours, but they don't find anything except more trees. Bob's stomach grumbles again and he knows they need to find food soon. He looks around and saw a bush loaded with ripe berries. He remembers how good they tasted earlier and starts to head towards it, but the woman stops him. "Wait," she says, "those berries are poisonous. I nearly ate some earlier, but I was lucky enough to remember in time. We need to find something else to eat." Bob's heart sinks. He had been so close to food, but now they are back to square one. He looks around desperately, trying to think of what to do. Then he sees a small stream not far from them and has an idea. "If we follow that stream, it might lead us to a lake or a river. And if we're lucky, we might find something to eat there." The woman agrees and they start following the stream. After a while, they come to a clearing and Bob's heart leaps with joy when he sees a small lake in front of them. He runs over to it and starts drinking, feeling the cool water revive his parched throat. The woman joins him and they drink their fill. Then they start looking around for something to eat. Bob's stomach grumbles, but he ignores it. He knows they need to find food soon, but he is also exhausted. He sits down on the bank of the lake and closes his eyes, trying to think of what to do next.
