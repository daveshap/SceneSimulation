Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the quiet beach. Aleksy is sitting on the sand, letting the waves crash over his feet. He's been up for a few hours already, but he likes to come to the beach to watch the sunrise and clear his head before starting his day. Aleksy works at a small grocery store a few miles from the beach. It's not his dream job, but it pays the bills and he enjoys the people he works with. He's been working there for a little over a year, ever since he moved to Asia to be closer to his family. This is Aleksy's favorite time of day. He likes to sit and watch the world wake up around him. He's never been a morning person, but something about the peace and quiet of the beach helps him start his day off on the right foot.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy continues to sit on the beach, watching as the sun slowly rises higher in the sky. The colors become more intense, and he can see people starting to wake up and move around on the beach. He hears the sound of laughter in the distance and sees a group of children running and playing in the sand. He smiles to himself, thinking about how much he used to enjoy coming to the beach when he was a kid. He remembers the feeling of the sand between his toes and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. He takes a deep breath and feels the fresh, salty air fill his lungs. He closes his eyes and feels the warm sun on his face. For a moment, he forgets all about his worries and just enjoys the peace and tranquility of the beach.
