Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is sitting in her hut, surrounded by her five children. It's been a long day and she's exhausted, but she knows she has to stay up a little longer to make sure her little ones are all fed and tucked in for the night. She starts a small fire in the center of the hut and begins to cook the evening meal. Her children watch eagerly as the pot of stew begins to simmer. Sandy ladles out bowls of steaming stew for her children and they all sit down to eat. As they eat, Sandy tells her children stories about her own childhood in Africa. She talks about the animals she used to see and the adventures she used to have. Her children listen raptly, their eyes wide with wonder. Eventually, Sandy tucks her children into bed, one by one. She kisses each of them goodnight, and tells them she loves them. Sandy then sits down by the fire to enjoy a few moments of peace before she, too, goes to bed. She gazes into the flames, lost in thought, until she finally falls asleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy wakes up to the sound of her children laughing. She opens her eyes and sees that the sun is already up. She must have slept for hours! She gets up and stretches, feeling well-rested for the first time in weeks. She goes over to the pot of stew and sees that it's still warm. She ladles out a bowl for herself and sits down to eat. Her children watch her, still giggling from their earlier game. Sandy asks them what they're laughing about and they excitedly tell her about the game they were just playing. Sandy listens, amused, as they tell her all about it. After breakfast, Sandy gets her children ready for the day. They brush their teeth and put on their clothes. Sandy opens the door of the hut and steps outside, blinking in the bright sunlight. She takes a deep breath of fresh air, feeling happy and content.
