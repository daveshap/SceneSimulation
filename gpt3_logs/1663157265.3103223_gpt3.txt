SCENE: Gabriella, or Gabbi for short, was your typical babysitter. She was in high school, and she loved kids. She was responsible, polite, and always had a smile on her face. She was currently babysitting for a family in a high-rise apartment building in the city. It was a beautiful day outside, and the family's children were playing in the park across the street. Gabbi was watching them from the window, making sure they were staying safe. Suddenly, Gabbi's phone rang. It was the mother of the children she was babysitting. She sounded panicked and said she was on her way home, but she would be a little late. Gabbi said it was no problem and that she would watch the children until she got home. The mother sounded relieved and thanked Gabbi before hanging up. Gabbi went back to watching the children, but now she was a little more on edge. She wanted to make sure the children were safe until their mother got home.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi continued to watch the children from the window, making sure they were staying safe. She was getting a little bit worried, as the mother still hadn't arrived home. Gabbi considered calling the mother to check in, but she didn't want to bother her if she was busy. Suddenly, Gabbi heard a loud crash from outside. She looked out the window and saw that a car had crashed into the park bench where the children were sitting. The children were screaming and crying, and Gabbi could see that they were all injured. She quickly called 911 and then rushed down to the park to help the children. She comforted them and stayed with them until the ambulance arrived. Gabbi was relieved when the mother arrived home and saw that her children were safe.
