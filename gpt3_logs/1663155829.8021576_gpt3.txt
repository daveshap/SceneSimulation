Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

As the sun began to set, the concertgoers started to fill the arena. Wang, a delivery driver, was stuck in the middle of the crowd. He tried to move but it was impossible. He was surrounded by people dancing and singing. The music was so loud that he could feel it vibrating through his body. He closed his eyes and tried to enjoy the moment, but after a while, he started to feel claustrophobic. He started to sweat and his heart started to race. He tried to push his way through the crowd but it was impossible. He started to feel lightheaded and dizzy. He tried to scream for help but no one could hear him. He felt like he was going to pass out. Suddenly, he felt a hand on his shoulder and he was pulled out of the crowd. He could breathe again. He opened his eyes and saw a security guard standing next to him. The guard told him to go to the first aid station. Wang nodded and tried to stand up but his legs were weak. The guard helped him to the first aid station where he was given some water and a place to sit down.
