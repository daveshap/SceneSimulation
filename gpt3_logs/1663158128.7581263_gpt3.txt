SCENE: It's a cold, clear night, and Swathi is standing on the top of a mountain in Europe. She's wrapped in a warm coat, but she still shivers slightly in the frigid air. She's looking up at the stars, and she's marveling at their beauty. She's been working on a software project for the past few weeks, and she's finally finished it. She's feeling proud of her accomplishment, and she's feeling grateful for the opportunity to work on such an interesting project.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi gazes up at the stars, her breath coming out in little puffs of steam. She's feeling proud of herself for completing her project, and she's feeling grateful for the opportunity to work on such an interesting project. She looks up at the constellation Orion and wonders if there's intelligent life on some of those distant stars. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her and she whirls around, her heart pounding. There's a large creature stalking towards her, its eyes gleaming in the moonlight. Swathi backs away slowly, her heart racing. The creature is getting closer and closer, and she knows she won't be able to outrun it. She's about to turn and run when she hears a voice in her head. "Don't be afraid," the voice says. "I won't hurt you." Swathi looks into the creature's eyes and she sees kindness there. She knows she's not in danger. The creature comes closer and nuzzles her hand with its snout. Swathi begins to pet the creature, and she feels a deep sense of peace. She knows she's made a friend for life.
