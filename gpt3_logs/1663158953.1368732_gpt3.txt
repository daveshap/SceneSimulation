Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun lazily rises over the horizon, casting a warm, orange glow over the landscape. A light breeze briefly ruffles the grass and leaves before dying down again. In the distance, a herd of elephants can be seen peacefully grazing. Closer to where Swathi is standing, a small group of gazelles are calmly drinking from a watering hole. Swathi watches them for a moment before continuing on her walk. She breathe in deeply, taking in the fresh, clean air. It's so different from the polluted air she's used to back home. She feels grateful for the opportunity to be here and experience this amazing place. As she walks, she notices a movement out of the corner of her eye. She turns to see a lioness stalking a nearby Zebra. She holds her breath, not wanting to disturb the natural order of things, and watches as the lioness brings the Zebra down with a single, powerful strike. It's an incredible sight, and one that she'll never forget.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The lioness drags the zebra carcass over to a nearby tree and begins to feast. Swathi watches in awe as the powerful predator tears into the meat. She can't help but feel a twinge of sadness at the sight of the dead zebra, but she knows that this is the natural order of things. She stays for a while, watching as the lioness finishes her meal. As she walks away, she finds herself feeling more connected to this place than ever before. She knows that she'll always remember this moment, and the incredible feeling of being in the presence of such powerful animals.
