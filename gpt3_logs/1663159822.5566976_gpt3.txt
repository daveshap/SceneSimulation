SCENE: Mashawn is standing on the mountaintop, gazing out at the sunset. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the mountains in the distance are a deep blue. The air is cool and fresh, and Mashawn can hear the sound of birds chirping in the distance. He feels a sense of peace and calm. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a loud noise behind him. He turns around and sees a group of construction workers, who are busy at work building a new structure. They are Noise, and the sound of their work echoes through the mountains. Mashawn watches the workers for a few minutes, before turning back to the sunset. He is filled with a sense of wonder and happiness, and he knows that this is a moment he will always remember.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn continues to stand on the mountaintop, watching the construction workers as they make noise and disrupt the peace of the mountain. He feels a sense of anger and frustration rising up inside of him, and he knows that he can't just stand there and do nothing. He has to act. Mashawn strides over to the construction workers and demand that they stop their work. He tells them that they are ruining the beauty of the mountain, and that they need to respect the peace and quiet that is supposed to characterize this place. The workers laugh at Mashawn and tell him that he's just a crazy old man who doesn't know what he's talking about. They tell him to go home and leave them to their work. Mashawn knows that he's not going to be able to reason with the workers, so he turns and starts to walk away. As he does, he hears one of the workers yell out, "We're going to build this structure whether you like it or not! You can't stop us!" Mashawn knows that the workers are right - there's nothing he can do to stop them. But he also knows that he can't just stand by and watch them destroy the mountain. He has to do something. Mashawn decides to go down to the city and try to talk to the people in charge of the construction project. He knows it's a long shot, but he has to try. He won't give up easily - he'll fight for the mountain until the very end.
