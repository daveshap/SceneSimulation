Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Jenna is in her bedroom, at her desk. It is dusk, and the light is beginning to fade. She is working on a school project, and she is having trouble concentrating. She keeps looking out the window at the trees and the sky, and she can hear the sound of the leaves rustling in the breeze. She is getting restless, and she keeps emailing her friend Sarah for help. Sarah is not responding, and Jenna is getting frustrated. She gets up from her desk and goes to the window. She opens it and leans out, breathing in the fresh air. She looks up at the sky and watches the clouds drift by. She feels a sense of peace and calm come over her, and she goes back to her desk and finishes her project.
