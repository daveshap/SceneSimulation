Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Gabbi was grateful to have found a job so quickly after moving to the city. Sure, it wasn't her dream job, but it paid the bills and that was all that mattered. She arrived at her first day of work, an office building in the financial district, and was surprised to find that her boss was a young woman, barely out of her 20s. Gabbi spent the morning getting oriented to her new surroundings and learning the ropes from her boss. She had just sat down at her desk to start working on her first project when she heard a loud crash from the other side of the office. She got up to investigate and found that one of the office workers had accidentally knocked over a stack of papers. Gabbi helped the woman clean up the mess and then returned to her desk. She was just getting back to work when she heard another crash, followed by a voice raised in anger. She got up again to see what was going on and found that two of her co-workers were arguing. Gabbi tried to diffused the situation and finally convinced the two women to go their separate ways. As she returned to her desk for the third time, she was beginning to feel like this was going to be a long day at the office.
