SCENE: Tom is a bartender at a concert in the park. It's dusk, and the concert is just winding down. Tom is busy cleaning up the bar and getting ready to close for the night. He's tired and sweaty, but he's also excited because he's just made a big sale. Tom is closing up the bar when he hears a commotion coming from the other side of the park. He heads over to see what's going on and finds a group of people gathered around a man who's lying on the ground. He's not moving and there's blood on his shirt. Tom pushes his way through the crowd and kneels down next to the man. He can see that he's not breathing and there's no pulse. He's going to need help, so he starts yelling for someone to call 911. While he's waiting for the paramedics to arrive, Tom does his best to comfort the man's wife. She's inconsolable, but Tom does his best to reassure her that everything will be alright. Eventually, the paramedics arrive and Tom steps back to let them do their job. He's relieved that he was able to help, but he's also saddened by the tragedy of it all.
