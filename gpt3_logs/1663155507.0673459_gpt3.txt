Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun had just started to peek over the horizon, sending long fingers of light through the trees and over the delicate flowers that surrounded the cottage. Birds were just starting to chirp their morning songs as Aleksy stepped out of the door, a basket under his arm. He stopped for a moment to take in the peacefulness of the morning, and then started down the path towards the village. He had to be at the store early today, and he didn't want to be late. The walk into the village was pleasant, and Aleksy breathed in the fresh air deeply, enjoying the peace and quiet. The village was still asleep when he arrived at the store, but he knew that wouldn't last long. He unlocked the door and stepped inside, flipping on the lights. He started unpacking the basket of produce he had brought with him, and then he heard the door open. He turned to see who it was, and his heart sank when he saw who it was. It was Vlad, the village bully. Vlad was a large man, and he always liked to intimidate people.Aleksy was sure that Vlad was going to make his life difficult today.
