SCENE: Aleksy finishes his shift at the grocery store and heads home to his country cottage. It's a peaceful evening, and the air is cool and fresh. Aleksy enjoys the quiet walk home, taking in the sights and sounds of nature. As he approaches his cottage, he can see the warm glow of the lamps inside. He opens the door and is greeted by his cat, who rubs against his legs. Aleksy smiles as he takes off his coat and hangs it up. He walks into the living room, where the fire is crackling in the fireplace. Aleksy sits down in his favourite chair and relaxes, enjoying the peace and quiet of his home.

Aleksy wakes up the next morning, feeling well-rested and refreshed. He gets out of bed and stretches, taking a deep breath and enjoying the peacefulness of his cottage. He walks into the kitchen, where he starts a pot of coffee and begins to prepare breakfast. He hums to himself as he works, feeling happy and content in his home. After breakfast, he cleans up the kitchen and then heads into the living room. He sits down in his chair and picks up a book, starting to read. He reads for a while, stopping occasionally to take a sip of coffee. The morning passes by peacefully, and Aleksy enjoys the quiet time at home.
