Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a cold, clear night, and Jenna is huddled under the Eifel Tower, trying to stay warm. She's been here for hours, ever since she ran away from home. She's not sure what she's going to do next, but she knows she can't go back. Jenna hears footsteps approaching, and she tense up, ready to run. But then she recognizes the figure as her friend, Alex. "What are you doing here?" Alex asks. "I ran away," Jenna says. "I can't go back home." "Come on," Alex says. "Let's go somewhere warm. I know a place." Jenna hesitates for a moment, but then she nods and follows Alex away from the Eifel Tower and into the night.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Alex leads Jenna away from the Eifel Tower and down a quiet side street. Jenna is grateful to be out of the cold and follows close behind Alex. "Where are we going?" Jenna asks. Alex doesn't answer, but instead quickens the pace. Jenna has to trot to keep up. Suddenly, Alex stops and Jenna almost runs into her. "What's wrong?" Jenna asks. "Shh," Alex says, holding a finger to her lips. Jenna follows Alex's gaze and sees a group of men standing in the alley ahead of them. The men are rough-looking and Jenna is afraid. "What do they want?" she whispers. "I don't know," Alex says. "But we need to get out of here." Jenna nods, and the two of them turn and run the other way. Jenna can hear the men coming after them, but they make it to the end of the street and turn the corner, losing them. "That was close," Alex says, panting. "Too close. Come on, we need to find a place to hide." Jenna nods and follows Alex away from the alley, her heart pounding in her chest.
