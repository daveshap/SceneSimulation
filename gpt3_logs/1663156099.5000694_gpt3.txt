Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Swathi is standing on a mountaintop in Europe, watching the sun set. She's wearing a light jacket to keep herself warm, and she's clutching a small bouquet of flowers. Swathi is smiling and looks very happy. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her. Swathi turns around to see a large, hairy creature standing a few feet away from her. The creature is taller than her and has a long snout. It's staring at her with its small, beady eyes. Swathi screams and runs away from the creature. She's running as fast as she can, but the creature is quickly catching up to her. Swathi trips on a rock and falls to the ground. The creature is now standing over her, drooling. Swathi closes her eyes and prepares for the worst. But then, she hears someone yelling. She opens her eyes to see a man running towards the creature, waving a large stick. The man hits the creature over the head with the stick, and it runs away. The man helps Swathi to her feet and asks if she's okay. Swathi nods, still in shock. She thanks the man for saving her and then runs back down the mountain, vowing never to return.
