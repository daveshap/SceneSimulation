Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is busy at work, hammering away at some nails that have come loose on the Eiffel Tower. He's been working on this project for weeks now, and he's getting tired. But he knows that he has to keep going until the job is done. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise from above. He looks up just in time to see the beam he's been working on starting to collapse. He tries to run out of the way, but he's not fast enough. The beam hits him on the head, and he falls to the ground, unconscious.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn is lying on the ground, unconscious, with the beam of the Eiffel Tower on top of him. His coworkers are rushing over, trying to figure out what to do. They know they need to get him out from under the beam, but it's too heavy for them to lift. Suddenly, they hear a loud creaking noise. They look up in horror as the entire structure of the Eiffel Tower starts to collapse. They all run for cover as the tower comes crashing down, smashing Mashawn beneath it.
