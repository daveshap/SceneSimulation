Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the mountaintops as Aleksy makes his way up the winding path. He stops for a moment to take in the view- the valley below him is blanketed in a thin layer of mist, and the first rays of sunlight are starting to filter through. As he continues on his way, he hears the sound of birdsong in the distance. He rounds a corner and comes upon a small clearing, where a family of deer are grazing. He stops to watch them for a moment before continuing on his way. He finally reaches the top of the mountain, where a small stone hut stands. He goes inside and lights a fire in the stove, then begins to prepare breakfast. As he works, he looks out the window at the breathtaking view of the valley below.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy finishes cooking breakfast and sits down at the small table to eat. He looks out the window at the view as he eats, and he's so taken aback by the beauty of it that he almost forgets to eat his food. He eventually snaps out of it and finishes his breakfast, then starts to clean up the hut. He sweeps the floors and dusts the surfaces, then washes the dishes and puts them away. He straightens up the bed and tidies the small living area, then steps outside to take a look around. The sun is higher in the sky now, and the mist has started to clear. He can see for miles in every direction, and the sight takes his breath away.
