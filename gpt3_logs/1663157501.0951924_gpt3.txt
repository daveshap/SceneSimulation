Aleksy is in the middle of Africa, in the middle of the night. He is a grocery store clerk who is trying to get some sleep. However, he is constantly being bothered by the sound of animals outside. He can hear lions roaring, hippos wallowing, and elephants trumpeting. Occasionally, he will also hear the sound of gunfire. This make it very difficult for him to get any rest. Aleksy gets up from his cot and goes over to the window. He looks out into the darkness and sees the silhouettes of animals moving around. He can see lions stalking prey, hippos playing in the water, and elephants eating leaves from trees. He can also hear the sound of gunfire in the distance. Aleksy sighs and goes back to his cot. He knows that he won't be able to get any rest with all of the noise. He lays down and tries to block out the sound of the animals, but it is difficult. He eventually falls into a fitful sleep.
