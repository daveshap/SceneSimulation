Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The bedroom is a mess, with clothes strewn everywhere and Swathi's laptop on the bed. It's lunch time, and Swathi is using her break to try and finish up some work. She's been stuck on this project for days, and is starting to get frustrated. The phone rings and she debates whether to answer it or not.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The phone continues to ring, and Swathi debates whether to answer it or not. She's so close to finishing this project, and she doesn't want to be interrupted. But the phone keeps ringing, and she eventually decides to answer it. "Hello?" she says, trying to sound as professional as possible. "Hey, Swathi, it's Raj," her boss says on the other end. "I need you to come into the office, we've got a problem." "Okay, I'll be right there," she says, hanging up the phone. She sighed, knowing that this project would have to wait. She quickly straightened up the bedroom, thrown on some clothes, and left for the office.
