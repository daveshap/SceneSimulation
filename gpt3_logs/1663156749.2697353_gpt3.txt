Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's lunch time, and Swathi is sitting in her office cubicle, munching on a sandwich and browsing the internet. She's surrounded by the low hum of conversations and the sound of keyboard typing; her coworkers are all busy working away on their own projects. Swathi's eyes wander to the clock on her computer screen; she still has another hour left before she can take her lunch break. She takes a sip of her soda and goes back to browsing the internet.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi's eyes continue to wander around the office as she takes another bite of her sandwich. She notices one of her coworkers, Brian, walking towards her cubicle. He's holding a stack of papers in one hand and a coffee mug in the other. "Hey Swathi," Brian says as he approaches. "I've got some reports here that I need you to take a look at." Swathi takes the reports from Brian and sets them down on her desk. "Sure thing," she says. "I'll take a look at them after my lunch break." "Great," Brian says. He takes a sip of his coffee and heads back to his own cubicle. Swathi goes back to eating her sandwich and browsing the internet. She occasionally glances at the reports on her desk, but she's not really in the mood to work on them just yet. She still has another half an hour before her lunch break is over, so she decides to just relax and enjoy her food.
