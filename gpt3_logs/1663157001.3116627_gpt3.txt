SCENE: It's a quiet night at the cottage. Aleksy is in bed, just about to drift off to sleep when he hears a noise outside. He gets up to investigate and sees a figure moving around in the shadows near the bushes. He watches as the figure comes closer to the house and then suddenly disappearing around the side. Aleksy is about to go back to bed when he hears the sound of glass breaking. He knows someone is trying to break into the house! He grabs a flashlight and heads outside to confront the intruder.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy slowly opens the door, heart pounding in his chest. He clicks on the flashlight, its beam piercing the darkness. He scans the yard, but there's no sign of the intruder. He's just about to go back inside when he hears a noise coming from the side of the house. He shines the light in that direction and sees a figure crouched down, trying to pry open the window. Aleksy shouts, "Hey! What are you doing?" The intruder glances up, then makes a break for it. Aleksy gives chase, but the intruder is too fast. He disappears into the night, leaving Aleksy alone and frustrated.
