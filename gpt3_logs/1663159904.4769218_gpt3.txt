Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is a delivery driver who is currently making a delivery under the Eiffel Tower. It is early in the morning and the streets are relatively empty. Wang is driving a small delivery truck and is currently stopped at a red light. He is waiting to turn onto a side street that will take him to his final destination. He is a little bit nervous as he has never made a delivery to this particular address before. He is also nervous because he is not familiar with the area and he does not want to get lost. As he sits at the red light, he looks out the window at the Eiffel Tower. It is an imposing structure and he cannot help but feel a little bit awestruck. He has always wanted to visit the tower but he has never had the opportunity. He wonders if he will ever have the chance to see it up close. The light turns green and Wang proceeds to turn onto the side street. He is relieved to see that there are no other vehicles on the street. He is also relieved to see that the address he is looking for is clearly marked. He pulls up to the address and parks the truck. He takes a deep breath and prepares to make the delivery.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang climbs out of the truck and stretches his legs. He looks up at the Eiffel Tower and marvels at its height. He then turns and looks at the address he is suppose to deliver to. It is a large, imposing structure and he can see that it will be a challenge to find the correct entrance. He grabs the delivery from the back of the truck and sets out to find the entrance. He walks around the building for a few minutes before he finally finds the entrance he is looking for. He goes inside and is met by a receptionist. He tells the receptionist who he is and why he is there. The receptionist tells him to have a seat and wait for a moment. Wang does as he is told and takes a seat. He looks around the room and notices that it is very lavish. He has never seen anything like it before. After a few minutes, a man comes out and introduces himself as the owner of the building. He tells Wang that he will take the delivery. Wang hands over the package and the man thanks him. Wang turns to leave but the man stops him and asks if he would like a tour of the building. Wang is surprised but he agrees. The man gives him a tour of the building and Wang is amazed by the opulence. He has never seen anything like it before. When the tour is over, the man thanks Wang for his time and hands him a business card. Wang thanks the man and leaves the building. He climbs into his truck and drives away, wondering if he will ever have the chance to see the inside of the building again.
