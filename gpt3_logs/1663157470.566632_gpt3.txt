Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's mid-afternoon and Bob is up on the mountaintop, enjoying the view. He's got his coffee shop up and running and he's doing a pretty good business. He's got a great view of the valley below and he can see for miles. He's got a few customers, but not many. He's just enjoying the peace and quiet when he hears a noise. He looks over and sees a group of people coming up the path. They're laughing and joking and having a good time. Bob knows them pretty well - they're a group of tourists who come up to his shop every year. They're always friendly and they always buy a lot of coffee. Bob waves to them and they wave back. They start to come up the path to his shop and he can see that they're carrying a bunch of gear. They're probably going to be staying up here for a while. Bob gets up and goes to meet them. He's glad to see them and he knows they're going to be good customers. He'll make sure they have a great stay up on the mountaintop.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The group of tourists come up to the shop and start to unload their gear. Bob can see that they're all tired from the hike up the mountain. He knows they're going to be thirsty and he's got just the thing for them. He's got a big pot of coffee on the stove and he's already getting some cups out. He knows they're going to want to sit down and relax, so he gets some chairs out for them. They all sit down and Bob starts pouring the coffee. They all take a cup and they all thank him. They all take a sip of the coffee and they all smile. They all sit back in their chairs and they all start to talk. They're all excited to be up on the mountain and they're all excited to see Bob's shop again. They all start to ask him about his business and how he's doing. He tells them all about his business and how he's doing. He's doing pretty well, but he's always looking for ways to improve. He's always looking for new customers and he's always looking for new products. He's always looking for ways to make his shop better. The group of tourists listen to him and they all nod their heads. They all agree that he's doing a great job. They all finish their coffee and they all stand up. They all thank Bob for the coffee and they all start to leave. They all say they'll see him tomorrow and they all wave goodbye. Bob waves back and he watches them as they walk down the path. He's glad they came up to his shop and he knows they're going to be good customers.
