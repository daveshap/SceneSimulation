SCENE: Jenna was laying on her towel on the beach, soaking up the sun and enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. She had been here for a few hours, but it felt like the day was just flying by. Jenna loved coming to this spot; it was so peaceful and calming. Suddenly, Jenna heard a loud noise and sat up to see a group of people running towards her. She was confused and scared, wondering what was happening. The group was getting closer and Jenna could see that they were all yelling and looked very panicked. Without knowing what else to do, Jenna got up and started running towards the group. As she got closer, she could hear them yelling, "There's a shark! There's a shark!" Jenna's heart sank as she realized what was happening. Everyone was running in different directions, trying to get away from the shark. Jenna was about to run towards the safety of the shore when she saw a little girl standing in the water, frozen in fear. Jenna's instinct was to save her. Without thinking any further, Jenna ran towards the girl and scooped her up in her arms. She then started sprinting towards the shore as fast as she could. Jenna's heart was pounding in her chest as she ran, but she didn't stop until she reached the safety of the sand. Once she was out of the water, Jenna put the little girl down and they both collapsed onto the sand, exhausted. Jenna was relieved that they were both safe and thankful that she was able to help.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna and the little girl sat on the sand, trying to catch their breath. Jenna was still in shock from what had just happened. She couldn't believe that there was a shark in the water. She looked over at the little girl and could see that she was still shaken up. Jenna wrapped her arms around her and tried to comfort her. They sat there for a few minutes, until Jenna finally gathered the strength to stand up. She walked over to the little girl's parents, who were standing on the shore, waiting for their daughter. They were both relieved and thankful that Jenna was able to save her. Jenna said her goodbyes and started to walk away, when she suddenly remembered that she left her towel and bag on the beach. She turned around and started to walk back, but then she heard someone yelling. She looked over and saw that the shark was still there, thrashing around in the water. Jenna's heart started to race as she realized that she would have to go back into the water to get her things. She didn't know if she could do it, but she knew she had to try. Jenna took a deep breath and ran towards the water.
