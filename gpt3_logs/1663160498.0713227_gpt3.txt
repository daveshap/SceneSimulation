SCENE: The sun rises over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the Paris skyline. Jenna stands under the Eiffel Tower, looking up at the majestic structure. She's been dreaming of visiting this city for years, and now she's finally here. She takes a deep breath and savors the moment. Jenna's parents had planned to take her on a European tour after she graduated high school, but sadly, they passed away before they could make the trip. Jenna was determined to see the places her parents had always wanted to take her, and so she saved up her own money and took the trip herself. Standing under the Eifel Tower, Jenna feels like anything is possible. She can't wait to explore the rest of the city and see all the sights. She knows her parents would be proud of her for making this trip.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna spends the morning walking around the city, taking in all the sights. She starts at the Eiffel Tower, then walks to the Louvre Museum. She spends a few hours there, admiring the artwork and thinking about her parents. After the Louvre, she grabs a quick bite to eat at a nearby cafe, then spends the afternoon walking around Notre Dame Cathedral and the Champs-Elysees. She does some shopping, buys a few souvenirs, and enjoys a gelato before heading back to her hotel. Jenna is exhausted from all the walking, but she's had an amazing day. She can't wait to see what tomorrow brings.
