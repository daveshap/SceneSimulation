SCENE: Jenna is standing under the Eifel Tower, enjoying the sights and sounds of Paris. She's been here for a few days now, and has loved every minute of it. She's wearing a light summer dress and sandals, and has a small backpack with her. Jenna is people watching and enjoying the atmosphere when she notices a man walking towards her. He's well-dressed and looks like he might be a tourist. He smiles at her as he gets closer, and she smiles back. The man comes up to her and asks her in broken English if she knows where the nearest restaurant is. Jenna hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should help him or not. But then she remember her high school French teacher telling her that one of the best things about travel is being able to help others, so she directs the man to a nearby cafe. The man thanks her profusely and walk away. Jenna goes back to people watching and enjoying the sunny day.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna enjoys the rest of her day exploring Paris and taking in the sights. She stops to get a crepe from a street vendor and enjoys it as she walks. She people watches some more and takes mental notes of all the different fashion styles she sees. As the sun starts to set, Jenna starts to make her way back to her Airbnb. She's tired from all the walking but is happy that she was able to explore so much of the city. As she's walking, she notices the same man from earlier. He's standing on the side of the street with a homeless woman. He's giving her some money and talking to her. Jenna feels a warmness inside as she sees this act of kindness and she is reminded why she loves to travel so much. It's moments like this that make all the planning and packing worth it.
