Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting and the sky is turning a deep shade of pink and orange. The birds are singing and the breeze is blowing through the trees. All is peaceful and tranquil. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. A car pulls up to the cottage and a young woman, Swathi, gets out. She looks around for a moment, taking in the peaceful surroundings, before making her way to the front door. She enters the cottage and is greeted by the smell of freshly baked bread. She follows the smell to the kitchen, where she finds a warm loaf of bread waiting for her. She smiles and takes a bite, savoring the flavor. After a few minutes, she sets the bread down and wanders into the living room. She flops down onto the comfortable sofa and lets out a sigh of contentment. It feels good to be home.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi sits on the sofa for a few minutes, letting the peacefulness of the cottage sink in. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, feeling her body relax. The sound of the birds outside the window is soothing, and the breeze through the trees makes a gentle rustling sound. After a few minutes, she gets up and wanders around the cottage, exploring each room. She smiles as she remembers all the good times she's had here. Finally, she make her way to her bedroom and get ready for bed. She climbs into bed and pulls the covers up to her chin, feeling safe and warm. As she drifts off to sleep, she can hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.
