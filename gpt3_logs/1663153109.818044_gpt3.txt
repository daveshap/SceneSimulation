Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Mashawn is sitting on the edge of a crater, his feet dangling over the edge. He's been working all day, and he's exhausted. The only sound is the faint buzz of his oxygen tank. He looks up at the stars, wondering if anyone is up there looking back at him. He thinks about his family back on Earth. He misses them, but he knows that he's doing important work. He's helping to build a new colony on the moon, and one day his children will be able to live here too. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a noise. He looks around, but he can't see anything.
