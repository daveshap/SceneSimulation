Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's mid-afternoon and Tom is in his bedroom. He's lying on his bed, fully clothed, with his arm across his eyes. He looks like he's trying to block out the light. There's a half-empty bottle of whiskey on the nightstand, and an empty glass next to it. It's clear that Tom has been drinking. He hears a noise and raises his head to see his girlfriend, Sarah, standing in the doorway. She's holding a suitcase in one hand and a box in the other. There's a look of determination on her face. Tom sits up and Sarah comes into the room. She puts the suitcase and box down and looks at Tom. "I'm leaving," she says. "I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry." Tom looks at her for a moment, then nods. He doesn't say anything. Sarah turns and picks up her things again. She starts to walk out of the room, but pauses and looks back at Tom. "I loved you," she says. "I really did." Then she's gone, and Tom is alone.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom sits in silence for a moment after Sarah leaves, staring at the spot where she was just standing. He feels numb, like he can't quite process what just happened. He looks over at the whiskey bottle and considers taking another drink, but decides against it. He knows he needs to think clearly if he's going to figure out what to do next. Tom gets up and walks over to the window. He looks out at the street below, watching as Sarah walks away from him. She seems so sure of herself, so certain that this is the right thing to do. But Tom can't help but feel like he's made a huge mistake. He knows he should go after her, try to talk to her and convince her to stay. But he also knows that it's probably too late for that. Tom turns away from the window and starts to pace the room. He runs his hands through his hair, feeling lost and confused. He can't believe this is happening. It all feels like a dream. He stops and sits down on the bed, burying his face in his hands. He doesn't know what to do or where to go from here.
