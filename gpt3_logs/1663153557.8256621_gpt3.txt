Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Mashawn is walking through the dark forest, trying to find his way back to camp. He is getting scared as the sun starts to set and the woods get darker. He hears some strange noises and starts to run, but trips on a tree root and falls to the ground. He looks up and sees a large beast standing over him, drooling and growling. Mashawn is terrified and thinks he is going to be eaten alive. The beast leans down and starts to sniff him, but then turns and walks away. Mashawn is relieved, but now he is lost and alone in the dark forest.
