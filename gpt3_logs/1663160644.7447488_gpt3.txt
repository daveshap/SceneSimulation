Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting against a backdrop of picturesque rolling hills, casting a warm, golden glow over the quaint country cottage. Sandy, a stay-at-home mom, is in the kitchen, putting the finishing touches on a simple but homey dinner of roast chicken and vegetables. The kids are already seated at the table, eagerly awaiting their meal. The whole family enjoys a peaceful, relaxed meal together, savoring the simple but delicious food and the warm, convivial atmosphere. After dinner, Sandy clears the dishes while the kids play happily in the living room. Then it's time for baths and bedtime stories, followed by some precious moments of snuggling and bonding before the kids drift off to sleep. Sandy retire to her own bedroom, feeling content and fulfilled. She thanks her lucky stars for her happy, healthy family as she drift off to sleep herself, dreaming of peaceful country mornings and family laughter.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The next morning, Sandy is up early, enjoying the peaceful quiet of the house. She savors a cup of coffee on the porch, watching the sun rise over the rolling hills. The kids will be up soon, so she goes inside to start breakfast. They'll need to be fed and dressed before heading off to school and her day of taking care of the house and taking care of herself. Sandy hums to herself as she works, feeling happy and content in her simple but perfect life.
