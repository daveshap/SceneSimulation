Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang had been driving his scooter along the beach all morning, making deliveries for the local businesses. It was now lunch time, and he was hungry. He decided to take a break and sit down on the beach to eat his lunch. He sat down on the sand and began to eat his rice and vegetable dish. He looked out at the water and saw the waves crashing against the shore. He watched as the seagulls flew overhead, looking for food. It was a peaceful scene. After he finished his lunch, Wang lay back on the sand and dozed off. He was content, surrounded by the sounds of the waves and the smell of the sea.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang awoke to the sound of someone calling his name. He sat up and saw his friend, Li, walking towards him. Li was carrying a fishing rod and a bucket of bait. "Hey, Wang! I thought I'd find you here. I'm going to go fishing. Care to join me?" Wang was tempted, but he knew he had to get back to work. "I wish I could, Li, but I have to finish my deliveries. Maybe another time." Li shrugged. "Suit yourself. I'll see you later." Wang watched as Li walked down to the water's edge and began to set up his gear. He envied his friend, being able to spend the afternoon relaxing and fishing. Maybe one day he would have the time to do that himself. For now, he had to get back to work. He stood up and brushed the sand off his clothes. Then he picked up his scooter and went back to work.
