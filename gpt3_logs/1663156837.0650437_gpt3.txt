Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The concert is in full swing and the crowd is loving it. Sandy is in the middle of the mosh pit, banging her head and dancing like crazy. She's surrounded by sweaty, rowdy concertgoers, and she's loving every minute of it. She's forgotten all about her troubles at home, and she's just living in the moment.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy is so caught up in the moment that she doesn't even notice when someone bumps into her and knocks her down. She hits her head on the ground and is momentarily dazed. She tries to get up, but her head is spinning and she can't seem to make her body cooperate. She's disoriented and confused, and she has no idea what's going on. She finally manages to get to her feet, but she's unsteady on her feet and she can't seem to focus her eyes. She starts to make her way towards the exit, but she's so dizzy that she can't walk in a straight line. She stumbles and falls a few times before finally making it out of the mosh pit. Once she's out, she sits down on the ground and puts her head between her knees, trying to make the world stop spinning.
