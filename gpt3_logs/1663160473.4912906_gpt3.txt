Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The night is dark and humid, with a thick canopy of trees blocking out most of the starlight.Only the faintest slivers of moonlight penetrate the dense foliage, casting an eerie glow over the forest floor. Mashawn is a construction worker who is on his way home from a late night shift. He is walking along a narrow path that winds its way through the forest, and he is tired and fatigued from a long day of work. As he trudges along, he hears a strange noise emanating from the darkness ahead of him. It sounds like something is moving through the underbrush, and it is getting closer. Mashawn begins to feel uneasy, and he quickens his pace. Suddenly, something leaps out at him from the shadows, and he lets out a scream as he is tackled to the ground...

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn is momentarily stunned as he hits the ground, and he feels something heavy pressing down on him. He tries to cry out for help, but the only thing that comes out is a muffled whimper. He can feel hot breath on his neck, and he smells a rank, animalistic odor. He is paralyzed with fear, and he knows that he is about to die. Suddenly, he hears a voice in his head, and it is the voice of his dead mother. She tells him to be brave, and to fight for his life. He hears her voice getting louder and more insistent, and he starts to struggle against his attacker. He manages to get one arm free, and he starts swinging wildly, trying to connect with anything he can. He feels his fist connect with something soft, and he hears a yelp of pain. He keeps swinging, and eventually he feels his attacker go limp. He pushes the body off of him and jumps to his feet, heart pounding in his chest. He looks around, but there is no sign of the attacker. He can hear the sound of something moving away in the distance, and he knows that he has been lucky to escape with his life. He starts to shake, and he knows that he will never forget what happened to him in the forest that night.
