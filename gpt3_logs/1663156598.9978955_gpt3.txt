SCENE: The cottage is located in the middle of a beautiful country field. The night is clear and the stars are shining brightly. Swathi is a software engineer who has been working on a new project for the past few weeks. She is up late tonight, working on some final coding before she takes a break. The project is almost complete, and she is feeling good about her work. However, she is also feeling a bit tired and decides to take a break for a few minutes. She gets up from her desk and stretches her arms. Then she walks over to the window and looks out at the peaceful countryside. She can hear the crickets chirping and the leaves rustling in the wind. It is a peaceful and calming night. After a few minutes, she goes back to her desk and continues working on her project.
