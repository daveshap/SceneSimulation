SCENE: Mashawn is sitting at a small table in the kitchen of a country cottage. It's lunch time, and he's enjoying a hearty meal of homemade soup and bread. The sun is shining in through the window, and the warm breeze is blowing through the open door. All is peaceful and calm.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The peace is shattered by the sound of raised voices and breaking glass. Mashawn jumps up from his chair, hurriedly stuffing the last bite of bread into his mouth. He runs to the door and peeks out to see what's going on. In the yard, two men are engaged in a heated argument. One of them has a glass bottle in his hand, and he's gesturing wildly with it. The other man is trying to calm him down, but it's not working. Suddenly, the man with the bottle throws it at the other man's head. He ducks out of the way just in time, and the bottle shatters against the stone wall of the cottage. Mashawn ducks back inside and grabs a skillet from the stove. He creeps back to the door and takes a deep breath before stepping outside. "Hey!" he shouts. "What's going on here?" The two men stop and look at him. The man with the bottle starts to say something, but the other man cuts him off. "This is none of your business, so just mind your own business and go back inside!" Mashawn clenches the skillet tightly and stands his ground. "I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on." The two men exchange a look, and then the man with the bottle speaks up. "My wife left me," he says, his voice breaking. "She took everything and left me with nothing." The other man puts a hand on his shoulder. "It's going to be okay," he says. "We'll help you get through this." Mashawn relaxes his grip on the skillet and nods. "Let me help too," he says. "I know how it feels to be alone." The man with the bottle nods and wipes away a tear from his eye. Together, the three men go inside the cottage and sit down at the kitchen table.
