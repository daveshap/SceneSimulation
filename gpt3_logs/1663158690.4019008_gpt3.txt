Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The crowd is electric, jumping and cheering as the band plays their final song. Jenna is in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by sweaty bodies bumping into her from all sides. She's elbowing and pushing her way through the crowd, trying to get closer to the stage. She can see the band members' faces now, they're dripping with sweat and grinning from ear to ear. She's so close, she can reach out and touch them. Suddenly, the music stops and the lights come on. Jenna blinks, trying to adjust to the sudden brightness. The crowd around her starts to disperse, and she realizes the concert is over. She's disappointed, but also a little relieved. Her arms and legs are sore from all the pushing and elbow-throwing. As she makes her way out of the venue, she spots a group of her friends. They wave her over, and she joins them as they head to the after-party.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna and her friends are at the after-party, which is being held at a nearby bar. They're all sitting around a table, drinking and chatting. Jenna is telling them about how she was so close to the stage, she could've reached out and touched the band members. Her friends are impressed, and they all wish they could've been there with her. They continue to drink and chat for a while, and then they decide to head out. Jenna is a little buzzed from the alcohol, but she's not too drunk. They all say their goodbyes and head in different directions. Jenna is walking home, and she's feeling good.She's a little sad that the concert is over, but she's also happy that she got to experience it. She's looking forward to the next one.
