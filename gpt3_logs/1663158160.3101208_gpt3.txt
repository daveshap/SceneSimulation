LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

Sandy sits on the mountaintop, watching the sun set over the picturesque European landscape. She's been here many times before, but it never fails to take her breath away. As the last rays of sunlight disappear, Sandy's thoughts turn to her children, who are at home with their father. She misses them terribly, but knows that she made the right decision when she decided to stay home and take care of them. Sandy knows that her children are in good hands, and she's confident that they'll be just fine without her. The next morning, Sandy wakes up early and sets off on a hike down the mountain. The views are even more breathtaking in the daylight, and she can't help but think of her children and how much they would love it here. She makes a mental note to bring them here next summer. As she nears the bottom of the mountain, Sandy hears shouting and laughing coming from a nearby village. She decides to investigate and soon comes across a group of children playing in a park. They remind her so much of her own children that she can't help but stop and watch them for a while. Eventually, Sandy tearfully heads back to her hotel, knowing that her children are the most important things in her life. No matter how much she loves travel and adventure, nothing can compare to the love she has for her children.
