SCENE: The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm and welcoming glow over the quaint country cottage. Tom, the bartender, had just finished his shift and was looking forward to heading home to his family. The cottage was located just outside of town, surrounded by open fields and tall trees. The peace and quiet was a welcome change after the hustle and bustle of the bar. Tom unlocked the door and stepped inside, taking a deep breath of the fresh, clean air. Everything was just as he had left it the night before. He made his way to the kitchen, where his wife was already busy preparing breakfast. They exchanged a warm embrace and sat down to enjoy a quiet meal together. After breakfast, Tom headed out to the porch to enjoy the rest of his morning. He breathed in the fresh air and felt the warm sun on his face. It was going to be a beautiful day.
