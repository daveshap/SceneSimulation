Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob walks into his bedroom, yawning and stretching his arms. He's had a long day at work and is looking forward to getting some rest. He kicks off his shoes and climbs into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin. He closes his eyes, but after a few minutes, he starts to feel restless. He tosses and turns, but can't seem to get comfortable. He gets out of bed and goes to the window, opening the curtains and letting in some fresh air. He looks out at the street below, studying the cars and people as they go about their evening. After a few minutes, he feels calmer and climbs back into bed. He closes his eyes and finally falls asleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob wakes up to the sound of birds chirping outside his window. He feels well-rested and refreshed after a good night's sleep. He climbs out of bed and stretches his arms, taking a deep breath in. He walks to the window and opens the curtains, letting in the bright sunlight. He squints his eyes and looks out at the street below. He can see people walking and cars driving by. He watches as a couple walks hand in hand down the street. He smiles to himself and feels a sense of peace. He closes the curtains and goes back to bed, snuggling under the covers. He feels content and happy as he drift off to sleep.
