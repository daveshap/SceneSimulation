Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna enters her bedroom and flops down on her bed. She stares up at the ceiling, lost in thought. Her mind is racing and she can't seem to focus on anything. She's trying to study for her upcoming biology test, but she can't seem to concentrate. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She sits up and grabs it, eager for a distraction. It's a text from her best friend, asking if she wants to come over and hang out. Jenna responds quickly, saying she'll be right there. She stands up and grabs her jacket, then heads for the door. She paused for a moment, hand on the doorknob, and takes a deep breath. She can do this. She's just a little stressed, that's all. She can't let her anxiety get the best of her. She opens the door and steps out into the hallway, then heads for her friend's house.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna walked quickly down the street, her mind still racing. She was glad her friend had texted her, she needed a distraction. She tried to focus on her friend's house, but her mind kept wandering. She was so stressed about her upcoming biology test. She knew she should be studying, but she just couldn't focus. She was sure she was going to fail. As she approached her friend's house, she took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down. She didn't want her friend to see how stressed she was. She forced a smile as she walked up to the door and rang the bell. Her friend answered the door and Jenna was enveloped in a hug. "I'm so glad you're here!" her friend said. Jenna smiled and stepped into the house. "I needed to get out of the house," she said. "I can imagine," her friend said sympathetically. "You've been studying so hard for that test." Jenna nodded. "I just feel like I'm going to fail," she said. "You're not going to fail," her friend said. "You're one of the smartest people I know." Jenna appreciated her friend's words, but she still couldn't shake the feeling that she was going to fail. She followed her friend into the living room and sat down on the couch. Maybe a little relaxation was what she needed. Her friend turned on the TV and they spent the next few hours just hanging out and distracting Jenna from her studies.
