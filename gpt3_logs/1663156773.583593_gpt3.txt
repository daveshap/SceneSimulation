Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Aleksy is sitting on a bench eating his lunch. He looks up at the sky and sees the Earth shining brightly. He thinks to himself how different lunchtime is on the moon. He then takes out his book and starts to read.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy sets his book down on the bench and looks up at the sky again. He marvels at how different the Earth looks from here. He can see the continents and the oceans, and he feels a sense of peace knowing that he is one small part of a much larger world. He looks back down at his book and opens it to the first page. He starts to read, but he can't focus on the words. He keeps thinking about the Earth and how beautiful it is. He closes his book and puts it back in his bag. He stands up and walks over to the edge of the crater. He looks down at the barren landscape and feels a sense of awe at the immense size of the universe. He looks up at the Earth one last time before heading back to his station.
