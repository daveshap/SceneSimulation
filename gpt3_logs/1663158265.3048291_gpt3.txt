SCENE: Gabbi is sitting on a bench under the Eifel Tower, eating her lunch and watching as the tourists pass by. She people-watches for a while, enjoying the diverse mix of people from all over the world who are all here to see this iconic landmark. After a while, she checks her phone and realizes that it's time to pick up her charge, a little girl named Emma, from school. She finishes her lunch and heads off to get Emma.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi checks her phone again to make sure she's got the right time, then stuffs it back into her pocket and stands up from the bench. She stretches her arms up over her head, taking a deep breath of the fresh Parisian air before heading off to pick up Emma from school. She weave in and out of the crowd of tourists, politely saying "excuse me" as she goes. Finally she breaks free from the mob and arrives at Emma's school. She waves to the little girl, who is sitting on the steps playing with her friends. Emma sees Gabbi and comes running over, giving her a big hug. "Hi Gabbi!" she says, beaming up at her. "Hey Emma, ready to go?" Gabbi replies, ruffling Emma's hair. Emma nods and takes Gabbi's hand as they walk away from the school, chatting and laughing together. They make their way back through the crowd of tourists, stopping to look at the Eifel Tower one last time before heading home.
