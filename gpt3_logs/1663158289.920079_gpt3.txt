SCENE: Gabbi is nervously walking through a dark forest in South America, looking for the house she is supposed to be babysitting at. It is 6pm and she is already an hour late. She is carrying a flashlight and a bag of babysitting supplies. She is wearing a brightly colored shirt and pants so she will be easier to see in the darkness. She is also wearing a pair of sneakers in case she needs to run away from anything. Gabbi hears a branch snap and stops in her tracks, shining her flashlight in the direction of the noise. She sees a large, furry creature standing in the shadows, watching her. She gasps and backs away slowly, never taking her eyes off of the creature. The creature starts to come towards her and Gabbi turns and runs in the opposite direction. She can hear the creature following her, but she doesn't look back. She runs until she reaches the house she is supposed to be babysitting at and goes inside, locking the door behind her. She is safe for now, but she is sure the creature is still out there, lurking in the darkness.

She is about to be caught when she trips on a root and goes sprawling to the ground. The creature is upon her in an instant. She looks into its eyes and sees her own death reflected there. She knows she is going to die. The creature opens its mouth to devour her and she screams...
