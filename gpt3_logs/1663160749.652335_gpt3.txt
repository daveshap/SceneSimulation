Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. Jenna is sitting on the porch of her country cottage, watching the colours change as the sun begins to dip below the tree line. She feels a sense of peace and calm wash over her as she takes in the serene scene before her. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is gently rustling the leaves. All is right in the world.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun slowly dips below the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. Jenna watches the colours change, feeling a sense of peace and calm wash over her. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is gently rustling the leaves. All is right in the world. Jenna feels her eyelids begin to droop, and she lets out a soft sigh. She knows she should go inside and get ready for bed, but she can't tear herself away from the peaceful scene before her. She's so lucky to live in such a beautiful place. Finally, Jenna forces herself to stand up and goes inside, closing the door behind her with a quiet click.
