Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Darkness falls swiftly on the moon, and Tom the bartender is getting ready to close up shop. He's been busy all day serving space tourists and weary astronauts, and is looking forward to getting home to his family. The last few customers trickle out, leaving Tom alone in the bar. He tidies up, washing glasses and wiping down the counter. Finally, he locks the door and heads home, looking up at the stars as he goes.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom makes his way home, taking a shortcut through the alley. He's looking forward to getting home to his family and putting his feet up. As he turns the corner into the alley, he doesn't see the figure lurking in the shadows. The figure comes up behind Tom and puts a hand over his mouth, dragging him into the darkness. Tom tries to struggle, but the figure is too strong. He feels a sharp pain in his back and everything goes black.
