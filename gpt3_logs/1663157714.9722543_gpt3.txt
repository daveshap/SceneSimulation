Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is walking home from work, exhausted from a long day on the construction site. He trudges through the crowded streets, dodging people as they hurry home from their own jobs. The city bustles with energy, even as the sun begins to set. Suddenly, Mashawn's phone rings. It's his boss, asking him to come back to the site for a few more hours of work. Mashawn groans, but agrees to go back. He knows he won't be able to make rent this month if he doesn't pick up some extra shifts. Mashawn trudges back to the construction site, where he spends another few hours toiling away. The work is hard, but he doesn't mind. He's just happy to have a job, even if it is back-breaking. Finally, Mashawn is finished for the day. He trudges back to his tiny apartment, where he collapsed into bed, exhausted from a long day of work.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn wakes up early the next morning, his body aching from the previous day's work. He slowly gets out of bed, wincing as his muscles protest. He knows he needs to get moving if he's going to make it to the construction site on time. He takes a quick shower, then throws on some clothes and heads out the door. The streets are already busy with people rushing to work. Mashawn weaves his way through the crowd, his mind focused on the day ahead. He knows he'll be working long hours again today, but he doesn't mind. He's just happy to have a job. He arrives at the construction site and punches in for his shift. He grabs a hard hat and a toolbelt, then heads out to the worksite. He spends the next few hours working on the foundation of the new building. The work is hard, but he's used to it by now. By lunchtime, Mashawn is starving. He takes a quick break to eat the sandwich his wife packed for him. He sits in the shade, enjoying the brief respite from the heat. He knows he'll have to get back to work soon, but for now, he just savors the peace and quiet. Eventually, Mashawn heads back to the worksite. He works until dusk, when his shift finally ends. He punches out, then trudges back to his apartment, exhausted from another long day.
