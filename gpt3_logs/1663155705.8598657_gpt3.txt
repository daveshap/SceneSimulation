==========

The concert is in full swing and the crowd is loving it. Sandy is in the middle of the mosh pit, banging her head and dancing like crazy. She's surrounded by sweaty, rowdy concertgoers, and she's loving every minute of it. She's forgotten all about her troubles at home, and she's just living in the moment.
