Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The soft light of the morning sun filtered through the leaves of the trees, casting a dappled pattern on the ground below. Swathi sat on a bench, her laptop open on her lap, absently scrolling through her Facebook feed as she waited for her train to arrive. She was wearing her usual work clothes - a well-pressed shirt and trousers - but she had foregone her usual heels in favor of a pair of comfortable flats. She had a cup of coffee in one hand and a croissant in the other, and she took occasional sips and bites as she scanned the screen. The sound of footsteps on the pavement interrupted her reverie, and she looked up to see a group of tourists approaching. They were chattering in a mix of French and English, and they stopped just in front of her, blocking her view of the tracks. Swathi sighed and took another sip of coffee, trying to tune out their conversation. Suddenly, the ground shook beneath her feet and she heard a loud rumble. Her heart leapt into her throat and she dropped her coffee cup, spilling the hot liquid onto her lap. The tourists screamed and ran in all directions, and Swathi quickly gathered her things and stood up. The Eifel Tower was crumbling before her eyes, pieces of metal and stone raining down onto the ground. Swathi stood frozen in shock, her eyes wide as she watched the destruction. Suddenly, a large piece of debris came hurtling towards her and she instinctively threw up her arms to protect her head. She felt a sharp pain as the debris hit her, and then everything went black.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi awoke to the sound of someone calling her name. She felt a sharp pain in her head and struggled to open her eyes. When she finally managed to open them, she saw that she was lying on the ground surrounded by debris. The Eifel Tower was still crumbling in the distance, and she could hear the screams of the tourists. Slowly, she sat up, wincing at the pain in her head. She saw a figure walking towards her through the debris and recognized it as one of the tourists. "Are you okay?" the woman asked, concern etched on her face. Swathi nodded, gingerly touching the back of her head. "I think so," she said. "What happened?" "I don't know," the woman replied. "We were just standing there and then the ground started shaking. The next thing I knew, the tower was collapsing." Swathi slowly got to her feet and looked around. The scene was one of devastation, with pieces of the tower strewn everywhere. She saw people running and crying, and the air was thick with dust and debris. Suddenly, she realized that she had lost her laptop and her phone in the chaos. "Come on," the woman said, taking her arm. "We need to get out of here." Swathi nodded and followed her as they made their way through the debris. They finally reached the safety of a nearby building and stepped inside. Swathi leaned against a wall, her heart pounding in her chest. She had never seen anything like this in her life, and she could hardly believe that she had survived.
