Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. A light breeze rustles the leaves of the trees surrounding the small country cottage. Birds are singing in the distance. All is peaceful and calm. Inside the cottage, Jenna is just waking up. She stretches and yawns, then climbs out of bed and heads to the window. She smiles as she looks out at the beautiful morning. Everything is so perfect and peaceful. Suddenly, Jenna hears a loud crash from the other room. She froze, her heart racing. What is that? She slowly creeps to the door and peeks around the corner. She sees a large, furry creature rummaging through her backpack, which is lying on the floor. Jenna gasps. It's a bear! The bear looks up and sees Jenna. For a moment, they just stare at each other. Then, Jenna turns and sprints out the door. She doesn't look back until she's safe.
