SCENE: It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon. The air is still and cool, and the only sound is the birds chirping in the trees. Mashawn is sitting on the porch of his country cottage, enjoying the peacefulness of the morning. He takes a sip of his coffee and looks out at the trees, thinking about the day ahead.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn continues to sit on the porch, enjoying the quiet morning. He takes another sip of coffee and stretches his arms overhead. He hears a car driving down the road and wonders who it could be this early in the morning. The car pulls into the driveway and Mashawn recognizes it as his neighbor's car. His neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, gets out of the car and waves. Mashawn waves back and calls out to her, asking what she's doing out so early. Mrs. Johnson replies that she's on her way to work and asks Mashawn how his day is going. Mashawn tells her that he's just enjoying the peaceful morning and getting ready for the day ahead. Mrs. Johnson says goodbye and drives off. Mashawn goes back to enjoying the quiet morning.
