SCENE: It's a dark and stormy night, and Aleksy is all alone in the grocery store. He's just finished his shift and is about to head home when he hears a strange noise coming from the back of the store. He cautiously approaches, trying to stay quiet, and peeks around the corner to see what's making the noise. To his horror, he sees a group of large, furry creatures rummaging through the store's food supply. They're giant rats! Aleksy is paralyzed with fear as he watches the rats devour everything in sight. He knows he should run, but he can't move. Suddenly, one of the rats notices him and starts to advance toward him, baring its sharp teeth. Aleksy knows he's about to become their next meal.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy's heart is pounding in his chest as he watches the rat approach. He's backed up against the wall, and there's nowhere to run. The rat is getting closer and closer, and Aleksy can see the sharp teeth glistening in the darkness. He's sure he's about to die. Just when the rat is about to reach him, Aleksy hears a loud bang. The rat drops to the ground, dead. Aleksy looks around to see who saved him, and he sees his co-worker, Paul, standing there with a baseball bat. "Paul! Thank God you're here! Those rats were about to kill me!" Aleksy exclaims. "Don't worry, you're safe now," Paul replies. Just then, they hear more noise coming from the back of the store. The rats are still there! Paul grabs Aleksy's hand and they start to run toward the front of the store. "We have to get out of here!" Paul yells. They reach the front door and Paul fumbles with the keys, trying to unlock it. The rats are getting closer and closer. Finally, he gets the door open and they both run outside. They're safe! Aleksy and Paul stand outside the store, trying to catch their breath. They can't believe they made it out alive. "That was close," Aleksy says. "Yeah, we better call the police. Those rats are going to be a problem for this neighborhood," Paul replies. They both head home, knowing they'll never forget the night they were almost killed by giant rats.
