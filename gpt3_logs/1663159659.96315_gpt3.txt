Suddenly, Gabbi hears a loud noise coming from outside. It sounds like someone is screaming. She runs to the window and looks out, and she sees a woman running down the street, being chased by a man with a knife. The woman is screaming for help, and the man is getting closer and closer to her. Gabbi knows she has to do something. She can't just let this woman be killed. She runs to the door and opens it, then she runs out into the street. The man with the knife sees her and starts running towards her, but Gabbi is faster. She runs to the woman and grabs her hand, then she starts running away from the man with the knife. The man is getting closer and closer, but Gabbi and the woman are getting further and further away. Finally, they lose him and they're safe. Gabbi and the woman catch their breath and they both start crying. They're both alive, and they're both safe.
