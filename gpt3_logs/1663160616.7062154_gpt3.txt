Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's early morning on the moon, and the light is just starting to peek over the horizon. Sandy is out on a walk, enjoying the quiet of the morning. The air is still and the only sound is the crunching of her footsteps on the dusty ground. She's walking along a path that leads to a small hill. From the top of the hill, you can see the Earth off in the distance. Sandy likes to come here to watch the sunrise and think about her life back on Earth. She's been on the moon for about a year now, and she's still not used to the everyday sights and sounds. Everything is so different here, but in a good way. It's like being in a whole new world. As she reaches the top of the hill, Sandy sits down and watches as the sun slowly rises over the Earth. The colors are beautiful, and she can see the different continents and countries. It's a peaceful moment, and Sandy feels lucky to be able to experience it.
