Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is in her kitchen, preparing dinner for her family. She is chopping vegetables and simmering a pot of soup on the stove. Outside, the sun is setting and the sky is turning a deep, rich blue. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is blowing through the leaves. Sandy's husband and two young children are in the living room, watching television and playing with toys. The family dog is asleep in his basket by the fireplace. Everything is calm and peaceful. The only sound is the gentle ticking of the clock on the wall and the occasional clink of a spoon against the pot.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy finishes chopping the vegetables and adds them to the pot of soup simmering on the stove. She gives it a stir, then goes to check on her husband and two young children in the living room. They are engrossed in a cartoon on television and don't notice her come in. The family dog is asleep in his basket by the fireplace. Sandy smiles and shakes her head at the peaceful scene before going back to the kitchen. Time passes and the soup is ready. Sandy calls her family to the dinner table and they all sit down to enjoy a warm meal together. They talk and laugh as they eat, relishing the time spent together. The sun has long since set and the sky is dark outside. The only sound now is the crackling of the logs in the fireplace and the ticking of the clock on the wall. The family finishes their dinner and Sandy starts to clear the table. Her husband offers to help but she waves him away, telling him to relax and enjoy the rest of his evening. She finishes cleaning up the kitchen and then joins her family in the living room. They spend the rest of the evening relaxing and chatting together, surrounded by the warmth of the fire.
