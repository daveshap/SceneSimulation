Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is shining brightly as Tom steps out of his car and approaches the quaint country cottage. He can hear the sound of birds chirping in the nearby trees and the gentle sound of a stream running nearby. As he approaches the front door, he notices the flowers in the garden are in full bloom and the bees are busy collecting pollen. He takes a deep breath of the fresh, country air and smiles. Tom unlockes the door and steps inside. The cottage is warm and inviting, with a cozy fire burning in the fireplace. He can see the kitchen through an open door, and everything looks clean and tidy. He sets his bag down and hangs up his coat, then heads into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. He takes a seat by the fire with his tea and closes his eyes, letting the peace and quiet of the cottage wash over him. He feels himself start to relax and drift off to sleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom is jarred awake by the sound of breaking glass. He leaps to his feet and rushes into the kitchen, heart pounding, to find the back door smashed open and a large, furry creature standing in the middle of the room, eating from the fridge. Tom's mind races as he tries to figure out what to do. The creature is obviously very strong and could easily hurt him, but he can't just stand by and let it destroy his cottage. He takes a step forward, trying to look as big and intimidating as possible, and shouts at the creature in a deep, booming voice. "Hey! Get out of here! This is my home and you're not welcome!" The creature pauses for a moment, looking at Tom with its beady eyes, before turning back to the fridge and helping itself to another snack. Tom knows he can't just stand there and do nothing, so he charges forward, swinging his arms and trying to scare the creature off. But it's too late; the creature has had enough and turns on Tom, swiping at him with its powerful claws. Tom tries to dodge, but he's not fast enough and the creature's claws slice open his arm, causing him to cry out in pain. He staggers backwards, clutching his arm, as the creature calmly walks out the door and disappears into the woods. Tom sinks to the floor, heart racing, as he tries to process what just happened. His arm is throbbing and he knows he needs to get to a hospital, but first he has to call the police and report the break-in. He picks himself up and heads to the phone, trying to ignore the pain in his arm, and starts to dial 911.
