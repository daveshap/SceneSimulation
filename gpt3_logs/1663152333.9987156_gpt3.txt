Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's a sunny day in Paris and Sandy is taking her kids to the park to play. They walk hand in hand through the streets, enjoying the sights and sounds of the city. When they reach the park, Sandy lets go of her kids' hands and they run off to play. She sits down on a bench and watches as they explore the playground. After a few minutes, Sandy's phone starts ringing. She pulls it out of her pocket and sees that it's her husband calling. She answers the phone and he starts talking to her about his day at work. Sandy listens patiently, occasionally interjecting with a question or comment. As they're talking, Sandy's kids come running up to her, asking for a snack. She tells her husband she has to go and ends the call. She reaches into her bag and pulls out a granola bar, handing it to her kids. They sit down on the bench next to her and start eating. Sandy watches as the kids play and enjoys the peaceful moment.
