Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Sandy is in her kitchen, preparing dinner for her family. She is chopping vegetables and simmering a pot of soup on the stove. Outside, the sun is setting and the sky is turning a deep, rich blue. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is blowing through the leaves. Sandy's husband and two young children are in the living room, watching television and playing with toys. The family dog is asleep in his basket by the fireplace. Everything is calm and peaceful. The only sound is the gentle ticking of the clock on the wall and the occasional clink of a spoon against the pot.
