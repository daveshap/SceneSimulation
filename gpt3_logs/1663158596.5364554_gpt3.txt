LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The concert is in full swing, and the music is loud and energetic. The crowd is dancing and cheering, and Bob is right in the middle of it all. He's having a great time, swaying along to the music and munching on his popcorn. Every now and then he takes a sip of his coffee, savoring the rich flavor. He's surrounded by happy, smiling people, and he can't help but feel happy himself. Suddenly, Bob feels someone bump into him from behind. He stumbles forward a few steps, spilling some of his coffee on the ground. He turns around to see a tall guy in a hoodie trying to push his way through the crowd. The guy looks angry and sweaty, and he's shoving people out of the way as he tries to get through. Bob tries to move out of the way, but the guy bumps into him again, this time knocking the popcorn out of his hand. Bob tries to say something, but the guy just pushes past him and disappears into the crowd. Bob is annoyed and a little bit angry. He bends down to pick up his popcorn, but it's been trampled into the ground. He stands up and looks around, but the guy who bumped into him is long gone. Bob sighs and turns back to the concert, but he doesn't feel as happy as he did before.
