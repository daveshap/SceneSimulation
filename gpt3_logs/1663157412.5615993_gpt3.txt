SCENE: The mountaintop is blanketed in a thick layer of fog, making it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of Sandy. She's been hiking for hours, and she's exhausted. She stops to take a break, and leans against a large rock to catch her breath. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is calling her name. Sandy can't see anyone, but she starts to walk towards the sound. The fog gets thicker and thicker, until she can't see her hand in front of her face. She's disoriented and lost. The noise gets louder and Sandy starts to run. She stumbles and falls, hitting her head on a rock. sandy is knocked unconscious.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy wakes up groggy and disoriented. Her head is throbbing and she can't see anything. It's pitch black. She feels around and realizes she's lying on the ground. She tries to stand up, but her legs are weak and she stumbles. She reaches out, trying to find something to support her, but her hands only touch emptiness. Sandy starts to panic. She has no idea where she is or how to get out. She feels around again, this time more frantically, but she still can't find anything. She starts to scream, but her voice echoes back at her, mocking her. Suddenly, she hears something moving in the darkness. Sandy freezes, her heart pounding. She can't see what's coming, but she knows it's coming for her.
