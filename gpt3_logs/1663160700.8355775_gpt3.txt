Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob is standing in the middle of his coffee shop, surrounded by the detritus of the day'sbusiness. Chairs are upended on tables, half-empty cups of coffee sit forgotten, and paper wrappers and napkins are strewn everywhere. The only light comes from the neon sign above the door, which casts a garish, red glow over everything. Suddenly, the door swings open and a man stagger in. He's obviously drunk, and he's clutching a bottle of what smells like cheap bourbon. Bob takes a step back, warily eyeing the man. The man weaves his way over to the counter and slumps down onto a stool. He looks up at Bob with bleary eyes and slurs, "Coffee. Black. Make it strong." Bob hesitates for a moment, but then he nods and begins to brew a cup of coffee. As he does, he keeps a close eye on the man, who seems to be getting more and more agitated. Suddenly, he lashes out, smashing his bottle on the counter and sending glass and liquor everywhere. "That's it!" Bob yells, reaching for the bat he keeps behind the counter. "You're out of here!" The man tries to stand up, but he's too unsteady on his feet. Bob grabs him by the arm and drags him to the door, throwing him out into the night. As the door swings shut, Bob can hear the man's enraged, drunken shouts fading into the distance.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob leans back against the door, heart pounding in his chest. His hands are shaking and he feels a little unsteady on his feet. It takes him a moment to catch his breath and compose himself. He turns back to the counter, where the remains of the bottle are still oozing bourbon. Bob sighs and starts to clean up the mess. He's got the bar swept and mopped in no time, and he's just starting to restock the shelves when he hears the sound of breaking glass. Bob freezes, heart sinking. He knows all too well what that sound means. He grabs the bat and heads for the door. As he swings it open, he's met with a scene of chaos. The drunken man is in the middle of the street, throwing rocks and bottles at cars and pedestrians alike. Bob watches in disbelief as the man staggers around, yelling and causing havoc. He knows he should call the police, but he can't bring himself to do it. He can't just stand by and watch this man destroy himself. Bob feels a sudden surge of courage and he stride out into the street. "Hey!" he shouts. "You need to stop this!" The man turns to him, a wild look in his eyes. Bob takes a step back, but he stands his ground. "Come on, let's go back inside and get you sobered up." The man just laughs and throws another rock. It narrowly misses Bob's head and shatters the window of a nearby car. Bob knows he's in over his head. He turns and sprints back to the safety of the coffee shop. He grabs his phone and dials 911. As he waits for the police to arrive, he can hear the man's drunken shouts fading into the distance.
