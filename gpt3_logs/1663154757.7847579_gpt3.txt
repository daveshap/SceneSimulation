Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It was a typical evening in Africa. The sun was setting and the temperature was starting to cool off. Gabbi was sitting on the porch of her home, watching the children she was babysitting play in the yard. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise coming from the direction of the jungle. It sounded like something was crashing through the bushes. Gabbi jumped up from her seat, her heart racing. The children had also heard the noise and had stopped playing. They were now gathered around Gabbi, clinging to her legs. Gabbi looked around, trying to see what was making the noise. She saw movement in the bushes and then a large, furry creature emerged. It was a gorrila! Gabbi was paralyzed with fear. The gorrila came closer and then, to her surprise, it simply sat down next to her and started eating some bananas that were lying on the porch. The children, seeing that the gorrila was not going to hurt them, slowly approached it and started to pet it. Gabbi was still in shock, but she was slowly starting to relax. After a few minutes, the gorrila finished the bananas and then got up and wandered back into the jungle. Gabbi and the children watched it go, still in disbelief at what had just happened.
