SCENE: It was mid-afternoon on the moon. Gabbi was a babysitter who was taking care of a group of children. They were playing in the sand and Gabbi was watching them. Suddenly, one of the children started to cry. Gabbi went over to see what was wrong. The child said that he was hungry. Gabbi didn't have any food with her, so she had to go to the nearest store to buy some.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi walked over to the child and knelt down. "What's wrong?" she asked. The child sniffled and pointed to his stomach. "I'm hungry," he said. Gabbi frowned. She didn't have any food with her, and the nearest store was a few minutes away. "I'll be right back," she said. "I'm just going to go buy some food." She stood up and dusting off her hands. Then she started walking towards the store.
