SCENE: Mashawn is working in an office building. He is doing some construction work. He is putting up some drywall. He is wearing a hard hat and a pair of jeans. He is sweating. He is working hard. He is listening to music on his headphones. He is in a good mood.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn is putting the finishing touches on the drywall when he hears his boss's voice behind him. He turns around and sees his boss walking towards him, flanked by two security guards. His boss looks angry. "Mashawn, what the hell are you doing?" he shouts. "You're supposed to be working on the wiring in this room, not the drywall!" "I'm sorry, boss," Mashawn says, taking off his hard hat. "I thought the drywall was more important." "Well, you thought wrong," his boss says. "Now get your ass back to work on the wiring. And don't come back until it's finished." The security guards escort Mashawn out of the room and down the hall. He knows he's in for a long day of work.
