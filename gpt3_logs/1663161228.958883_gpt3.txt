Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is walking home from her friend's house late at night. She is alone and the streets are empty. The only sound is the clicking of her heels on the pavement. She is walking quickly, but she is not afraid. She knows these streets like the back of her hand. She turns the corner onto her street and sees a man standing in the shadows, watching her. She doesn't slow down or change her course. She knows he is not going to hurt her. As she passes him, she can feel his eyes on her. She can sense his presence, even though he is not saying or doing anything. She knows he is there, but she does not turn around. She continues walking until she reaches her house. She unlocks the door and goes inside, safe and sound.

Jenna is walking home from her friend's house late at night. She is alone and the streets are empty. The only sound is the clicking of her heels on the pavement. She is walking quickly, but she is not afraid. She knows these streets like the back of her hand. She turns the corner onto her street and sees a man standing in the shadows, watching her.

She can sense his presence, even though he is not saying or doing anything. She knows he is there, but she does not turn around. She continues walking until she reaches her house. She unlocks the door and goes inside, safe and sound. She turns on the light and looks out the window to see the man still standing there, watching her. She feels a chill run down her spine, but she is not afraid. She knows he is not going to hurt her.
