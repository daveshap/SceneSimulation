As she enters, she is enveloped in the comforting smells of home cooking. Her husband and children are gathered around the table, and they all smile when they see her.

The next morning, Sandy wakes up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful hue of orange and pink. Sandy stretches and yawns, feeling refreshed and ready to start her day. She gets out of bed and heads to the kitchen, where her husband is already busy making breakfast. They chat while they eat, and then Sandy kisses her husband goodbye as she heads out the door for her daily walk. The air is crisp and the leaves are turning red and gold. Sandy feels grateful for each and every day she spends in her beautiful country cottage.
