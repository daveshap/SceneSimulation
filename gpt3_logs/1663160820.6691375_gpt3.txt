Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is standing on a mountaintop in Europe, gazing out at the setting sun. She's been up here for hours, just soaking in the tranquility of the moment. It's been a long day and she's ready to head back down to the lodge, but she can't tear herself away from the view. The sun is verging on the horizon, painting the sky in a spectrum of oranges, pinks, and purples. The shadows of the mountains stretch out before her, and she can see the lights of the village flickering in the distance. A cool breeze brushes her face, and she takes a deep breath of the crisp, clean air. She feels so alive up here, surrounded by nature. It's a world away from the hustle and bustle of her everyday life back home. For a moment, she forgets all her troubles and just enjoys the peace and beauty of her surroundings. Eventually, Sandy tear herself away from the view and starts the long walk back down the mountain. She has a lot to think about and she knows she won't find the answers she's looking for up here, but it's nice to have a little break from reality every now and then.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy starts the long walk back down the mountain, her mind racing with all the thoughts and emotions she's experienced over the past few hours. She's definitely not ready to go back to the lodge and face reality just yet, but she knows she can't stay up here forever. As she walks, she takes one last look back at the setting sun, now a glowing orb on the horizon. She pauses for a moment, admiring the way the colors have changed since she was last up here. The sky is now a deep purple, and the stars are starting to come out. She can see the lights of the village in the distance, and she's reminded of all the people down there who are going through their own struggles. She takes a deep breath and starts the descent, feeling grateful for the peace and beauty of her surroundings, even if it is only for a little while.
