Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun is barely visible through the thick trees, casting a dappled light on the forest floor. Sandy is picking her way carefully through the undergrowth, her eyes darting around for any signs of danger. She is on edge, aware that this is not a safe place for a woman alone. Suddenly, she hears a rustling in the bushes ahead of her and her heart sinks. She knows she is not alone in this place anymore. Tentatively, she takes a few steps forward, peering into the darkness. And then she sees it. A huge, furry creature is standing in front of her, its yellow eyes boring into her soul. She knows she is in danger now. Slowly, she backs away, her heart pounding in her chest. The creature follows her, stalking her like prey. She knows she is not going to make it out of this alive.
