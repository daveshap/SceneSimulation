SCENE: Aleksy is standing under the Eiffel Tower, gazing up at the structure in wonder. He's never seen anything like it before and is awestruck by its size and beauty. He can hear the hustle and bustle of the city around him, but it feels like a million miles away. He's lost in the moment, imagining what it must have been like to build something so incredible.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy is still standing under the Eiffel Tower, but he has started to notice the people around him. He sees a young couple kissing, an old man feeding the pigeons, and a group of children laughing. He can't help but smile at the happiness around him. He looks back up at the tower and is filled with a sense of peace. He knows he'll always remember this moment.
