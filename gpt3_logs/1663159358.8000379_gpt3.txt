Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Aleksy slowly opens his eyes and takes in his surroundings. He is lying on a comfortable bed in a quiet room. Sunlight is streaming in through the window, casting a warm glow on the walls. He can hear the sound of birds chirping outside. He stretches lazily and gets out of bed. He walks over to the window and looks out at the beautiful scenery. He can see a small lake in the distance, surrounded by trees. The grass is green and there are flowers blooming everywhere. He takes a deep breath of the fresh air and smiles. He suddenly remembers that he has to go to work soon and hastens to get ready. He quickly washes his face and brushes his teeth. He puts on his clothes and grabs his bag, then heads out the door. As he walks down the path to the main road, he takes in the sights and sounds of the countryside. He sees a rabbit scurry across the path and hears the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze. He feels thankful for the peace and quiet of the countryside. When he arrives at the grocery store, he greets his co-workers and begins his shift. He is happy to be able to work in such a peaceful environment.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy finishes his shift at the grocery store and walks back home. He takes the same peaceful path through the countryside, enjoying the fresh air and the sound of the birds chirping. He arrives at his house and goes inside. He finds his wife in the kitchen, preparing dinner. They chat for a while and then sit down to eat. After dinner, they spend some time relaxing in the living room. Aleksy's wife reads a book while he listens to music. Eventually, they both head to bed. Aleksy's wife falls asleep quickly, but Aleksy has trouble falling asleep. He tosses and turns for a while, then gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen for a glass of water. As he's drinking his water, he hears a noise outside. He goes to the window and looks out. He sees a large animal moving around in the darkness. He can't tell what it is, but it looks big and dangerous. He quickly goes back to bed and tries to fall asleep, but he can't stop thinking about the animal outside.
