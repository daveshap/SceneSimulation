Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The concert is in full swing and the crowd is going wild. Swathi is standing in the middle of it all, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. She's wearing a flowy white dress and her hair is flowing down her back in loose waves. She looks like a goddess amidst the chaos and she's completely in her element. The music is loud and the bass is throbbing, but Swathi doesn't mind. She's lost in the moment, dancing with her eyes closed and her arms up in the air. She's completely absorbed in the music and the energy of the crowd around her. Suddenly, she feels someone bump into her from behind. She opens her eyes and turns to see a tall, handsome man standing there. He apologizes and they start talking. Swathi can't believe her luck when she finds out that he's also a software engineer. They bond over their shared love of music and dance the night away.
