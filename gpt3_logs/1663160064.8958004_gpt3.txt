SCENE: Jenna is sitting on a fallen tree in a dark forest in South America, eating her lunch. She is surrounded by tall trees and foliage, and the only sound is the occasional bird call. The forest is eerily quiet and Jenna feels a little uneasy. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap and she jumps to her feet, heart pounding. She looks around but doesn't see anything. She tells herself it was just an animal and sits back down, but she can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her.

==========

Jenna is sitting on a fallen tree in a dark forest in South America, eating her lunch. She is surrounded by tall trees and foliage, and the only sound is the occasional bird call. The forest is eerily quiet and Jenna feels a little uneasy. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap and she jumps to her feet, heart pounding. She looks around but doesn't see anything. She tells herself it was just an animal and sits back down, but she can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her. She looks around again, slowly this time, and sees a pair of eyes glaring at her from behind a tree. Jenna's heart sinks and she starts to back away slowly. The eyes come closer and she can see that it's a jaguar. Jenna turns and runs the opposite direction, but she can hear the jaguar's heavy footsteps behind her. She knows she won't be able to outrun it. Jenna starts to panic and tripping, she falls to the ground. The jaguar is upon her in an instant, and Jenna screams as it sinks its teeth into her flesh.
