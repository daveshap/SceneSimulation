SCENE: Jenna is walking on the surface of the moon, enjoying the evening air. She's wearing a suit that protects her from the harsh environment and her helmet has a tinted visor to keep the bright sun out of her eyes. Jenna is carrying a backpack with her supplies for the journey. She's been walking for hours, and she's getting tired. Jenna stops to rest for a few minutes, sitting on a large rock. She takes a drink of water from her canteen and looks up at the stars. Jenna can't believe she's really here on the moon. It's something she's always dreamed of doing, and she's finally made it. Jenna gets up and starts walking again. She's not sure how much further she has to go, but she knows she'll find her way. After a while, she comes to a small crater. Jenna climbs down into the crater and starts to explore. She finds some interesting rocks and takes some pictures. Jenna is having the time of her life. Suddenly, Jenna hears a noise. She turns around and sees a large, dark creature standing at the edge of the crater, watching her. Jenna is terrified and doesn't know what to do. The creature starts to walk towards her, and Jenna backs away. She trips over a rock and falls, hitting her head on the ground. Jenna passes out. When she wakes up, Jenna is inside a spaceship. She has no idea how she got there. She sees the creature that took her and it's not scary anymore. In fact, it looks kind of friendly. Jenna is surprised, but she's not scared. She knows she's safe now.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna wakes up slowly, her head throbbing. She can see the creature watching her from the other side of the room and she tries to sit up. She feels disoriented and unsteady. The creature comes over to her and helps her to a sitting position. Jenna looks around and realizes she's inside some kind of spaceship. She has no idea how she got here. The creature speaks to her in a language she doesn't understand, but she feels reassured by its tone. Jenna looks at the creature and slowly stands up. She takes a few steps forward and looks out the window. She can see the moon below them and she gasps. The creature comes to stand next to her and points to the window. Jenna sees that they are orbiting the moon. She looks at the creature and smiles. She knows she's safe now.
