Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The early morning sun casts a pale glow over the barren landscape of the moon. Aleksy, a grocery store clerk, is taking his regular morning walk, enjoying the tranquility of the morning. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise behind him. He turns around to see a large object hurtling towards him at high speed. He has just enough time to register the fear on his face before the object hits him, sending him flying through the air. Aleksy crashes to the ground, unconscious. He is bleeding heavily from a head wound. The impact has caused his helmet to crack, and his oxygen supply is leaking out. If he doesn't get help soon, he will die.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy wakes up to the sound of his own labored breathing. His head feels like it's about to split open, and there's a sharp pain in his side. He tries to sit up, but the world starts spinning and he has to lie back down. He's disoriented and confused, trying to remember what happened. Suddenly, it all comes rushing back to him. The impact, the pain, the fear. He remembers seeing the object coming towards him, and then everything went black. Aleksy looks around, trying to get his bearings. He's lying in a crater, and his helmet is cracked. He can see the oxygen leaking out, and he knows he doesn't have much time. He has to find help before he runs out of air. He tries to stand up, but his legs are weak and shaking. He starts to stumble towards the nearest airlock, but he knows he won't make it. He falls to his knees, gasping for breath, and he knows this is the end.
