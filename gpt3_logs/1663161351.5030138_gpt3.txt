She is walking quickly, as she is late for her babysitting job. As Gabbi walks, she notices a group of teenagers loitering on the corner. She tries to avoid them, but they call out to her. "Hey, babysitter! Come over here!" Gabbi ignores them and continues walking, but they follow her. "Come on, babysitter, we just want to talk to you." Gabbi quickens her pace, but they continue to follow her. Finally, she reaches her destination and runs up to the door, banging on it frantically. The teenager catch up to her and grab her arm. "Let me go! I have to babysit!" The teenager laugh and begin to drag her away. Gabbi screams for help, but no one comes. She is abducted by the teenagers and taken to an unknown location.

Gabbi screams for help as the teenagers drag her away, but no one comes to her aid. She struggles to free herself from their grip, but they are too strong. They drag her to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Gabbi pleads with them to let her go, but they only laugh. The leader of the group, a tall boy with dark hair, steps forward. "We're going to have some fun with you, babysitter." He pulls a knife from his pocket and Gabbi screams. The boy steps forward and slits her throat. As she lay dying, Gabbi hears the sound of laughter echoing in her mind.
