Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The night is pitch black, except for the soft glow of the moonlight reflecting off the ocean. Swathi is walking along the beach, her feet sinking into the sand with each step. She's wearing a light summer dress and carrying a small bag. She looks around, taking in the peacefulness of the scene. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her. She turns around and sees a large dark shape coming towards her. She starts to run, but the thing is faster. It catches up to her and knocks her to the ground. She feels something sharp piercing her skin and cries out in pain. The last thing she sees before she blacks out is the creatures face, with its large teeth and red eyes.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The creature drags Swathi's unconscious body into the darkness, its large teeth sinking into her flesh. She feels the sharp pain of the creature's claws as they puncture her skin. The last thing she sees before she blacks out is the creature's face, with its large teeth and red eyes.
