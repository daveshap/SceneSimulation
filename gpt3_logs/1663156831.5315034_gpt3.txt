Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. The birds are chirping and the wind is blowing gently through the trees. There's a sense of peace and tranquility in the air. Tom is sitting on the porch of his country cottage, enjoying the quiet evening. He's sipping on a beer and listening to the sounds of nature. He's got a smile on his face, and he looks content. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. Tom gets up from his chair and walks to the edge of the porch, curious to see who's coming. A car comes into view, and Tom recognizes it as his neighbor's. He knows that they're going away for the weekend, so he's not sure why they're coming back. The car pulls up to the house and the door opens. Tom's neighbor, Bill, steps out. He looks distraught and there's a sense of urgency in his movements. Tom walks down the steps to meet him. "Bill, what's wrong? What's going on?" "It's my wife, Tom. She's in the car, and she's not breathing. I think she's had a heart attack."

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom rushes to the car to see his neighbor's wife lying in the back seat. He can see that she is not breathing and her skin is pale. He knows he needs to act fast. He tells Bill to call 911 and he will start CPR. Tom lays the woman down on the ground and begins chest compressions. He can hear the sirens in the distance and he knows help is on the way. The woman begins to cough and Tom helps her sit up. She is breathing now, but she is still very pale. The ambulance arrives and the paramedics rush to help the woman. They load her into the ambulance and Tom and Bill follow behind in Bill's car. They arrive at the hospital and the woman is rushed into the ER. The doctors and nurses are working frantically to stabilize her. Tom and Bill are led to a waiting room where they sit and wait for news. After what seems like hours, a doctor comes out to speak to them. He tells them that the woman is going to be okay. They are both relieved and grateful.
