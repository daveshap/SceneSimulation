SCENE: Aleksy climbs to the top of the mountain, gasping for breath in the thin air. He reaches the summit just as the sun is setting, painting the sky in a beautiful array of colors. He looks out over the valley below, taking in the sights and sounds of the peaceful countryside. He feels a sense of calm and tranquility wash over him. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He turns to see a large bird swooping down towards him. He tries to run, but the bird is too fast. It grabs him in its claws and lifts him into the air. Aleksy screams as he is carried away into the night.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The bird carries Aleksy high into the air, its powerful claws clutching him tightly. Aleksy screams and struggles, but it is no use. The bird flies over the valley, the moonlight glinting off its glossy feathers. He can see the small houses and farms dotting the landscape below, and the sparkle of the river as it winds its way through the valley. The bird begins to climb higher, and Aleksy's ears pop as the pressure changes. He looks up and sees the bird's beak opening wide, ready to devour him. Aleksy closes his eyes and prepares for the worst.Suddenly, he feels the bird's claws release him and he tumbles through the air. He flails his arms and legs, trying to grab onto something, but there is nothing to hold onto. He falls and falls, the wind rushing past his ears. He hears the bird's triumphant cry as it flies away. Just when Aleksy thinks he is going to die, he hits something soft. He opens his eyes to see he is lying in a pile of hay. He is back on the ground, safe and sound. Aleksy lets out a sigh of relief and climbs out of the haystack. He dusts himself off and looks up at the mountain, vowing never to go back up there again.
