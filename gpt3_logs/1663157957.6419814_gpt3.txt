Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as Wang weaves his way through the throng of people gathered in the park. He's got a delivery to make, and he doesn't want to be late. The concertgoers are milling about, chatting and laughing, enjoying the early morning air. There's a palpable excitement in the air - everyone knows that the headlining act is about to take the stage soon. Wang expertly navigates his way through the crowd, finally spotting his target near the front of the stage. He weaves his way over, being careful not to jostle anyone, and delivers the package. The recipient, a young woman, thanks him with a smile. She's got a good spot near the front, and she's obviously excited for the show. Wang turns to leave, but not before he's caught up in the excitement himself. He can't help but stop and watch as the first band takes the stage and starts to play. It's going to be a good day.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The first band's set is in full swing, and the crowd is loving it. Wang is still near the front of the stage, and he's totally caught up in the music. He's bobbing his head along to the beat and tapping his feet, and he's even singing along to some of the songs. He's totally lost in the moment, and he's having the time of his life. The next thing he knows, the set is over and the crowd is cheering. He's not ready for it to end, but he knows that the headlining act is about to take the stage. He's on the edge of his seat in excitement, and he's ready to rock out.
