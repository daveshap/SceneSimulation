Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The darkness of the forest closes in around Tom as he walks, the afternoon sun filtered through the thick canopy of leaves overhead. He has been walking for hours, ever since he left the safety of the last village he had passed through. His destination is a small cabin deep in the woods that serves as a bar for loggers and hunters who come through this way. He finally arrives at the cabin, tired and sweaty from his hike. He opens the door and steps inside, relieved to be out of the heat and humidity. The bar is empty, except for a man sitting at one of the tables, nursing a drink. Tom walks up to the man and asks what he's drinking. The man replies that it's a special concoction made with herbs and spices that he won't tell Tom about. Tom shrugs and goes to the other side of the bar to pour himself a drink. As he sips his drink, Tom looks around the cabin. It's crudely furnished, with a few tables and chairs, and a makeshift bar made out of an old door. There are no windows, and the only light comes from a few candles that are burning on the tables. The door opens and two men come in, laughing and joking with each other. They sit down at the table with the man who wouldn't tell Tom what he was drinking, and start to play a card game. Tom leans against the bar and sips his drink, watching the men play cards and trying to ignore the feeling of dread that is building up inside of him.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The man who wouldn't tell Tom what he was drinking looks up at him and smiles. Tom returns the smile, but his mind is racing. He can't shake the feeling that something is about to happen. The door opens again and two more men come in. They sit down at the table with the other three men and start to play cards. Tom tries to act casual, but he can feel the sweat beading on his forehead. He takes a sip of his drink and looks around the cabin, trying to spot an escape route. The only way out is the door, and there are now six men between him and it. He takes another sip of his drink and tries to calm himself down. He doesn't want to show the men that he's afraid. The men finish their game and stand up, stretching and yawning. One of them walks over to the bar and pours himself a drink. He looks at Tom and asks him what he's doing here. Tom tells him that he's just passing through and that he's on his way to the next village. The man takes a sip of his drink and asks Tom if he has anything to eat. Tom tells him that he doesn't have anything, but the man doesn't believe him. He says that Tom must have something, because otherwise he wouldn't be here. The man walks around the bar and stands close to Tom. Tom can feel the man's breath on his face, and he can smell the alcohol on his breath. The man asks Tom again if he has anything to eat, and Tom tells him that he doesn't. The man doesn't believe him, and he starts to search Tom's pockets. Tom tries to push him away, but the man is too strong. He finds Tom's knife in his pocket and holds it up, laughing. The other men come over and start to search Tom as well. They find his money and his food, and they take it all. The man who found Tom's knife stands in front of him and points the knife at his face. He asks Tom if he has anything else, and Tom tells him no. The man doesn't believe him, and he starts to cut Tom's clothes off. Tom tries to fight back, but the man is too strong. He cuts Tom's shirt off and then starts to cut his pants. Tom is trying to think of a way to escape, but he can't. The man cuts Tom's pants off and then steps back, looking at him. Tom is standing there, naked and vulnerable. The man asks Tom one last time if he has anything else, and Tom tells him no. The man doesn't believe him, but he doesn't want to torture Tom any longer. He tells Tom to get out of the cabin and never come back. Tom picks up his clothes and runs out of the cabin, not looking back.
