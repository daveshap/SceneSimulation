SCENE: Aleksy had always wanted to see the mountaintops of Europe. They had always looked so peaceful and calming in the pictures he had seen. And now here he was, standing on one himself. He took a deep breath in and closed his eyes, savoring the moment. The sun was just beginning to set, casting a beautiful pink and orange hue in the sky. Aleksy felt like he could stay here forever. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the distance. It sounded like someone was crying. He followed the sound until he came to a clearing. And there he saw a woman, sitting on the ground, her face in her hands. Aleksy approached her cautiously. "Hello? Are you okay?" The woman looked up at him, her eyes red and swollen from crying. "No," she said, her voice shaking. "I'm not okay." Aleksy sat down next to her and put a comforting hand on her back. "It's going to be alright," he said softly. "Whatever it is, we'll figure it out." The woman took a deep breath and began to tell him her story. She had come up here to see the sunset, just like he had. But she had gotten lost on the way back down. She had been walking for hours, and she was starting to get cold and hungry. Aleksy listened sympathetically as she spoke. Then he stood up and held out his hand to her. "Come on," he said. "I'll take you back to my village. We'll get you something to eat and a warm place to sleep." The woman took his hand and Aleksy helped her to her feet. Together, they began the walk back down the mountain.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy and the woman made their way back down the mountain, hand in hand. The woman was grateful to have Aleksy's help, and she leaned on him for support as they walked. Aleksy was glad he had been there to help her; he knew how easy it was to get lost on the mountain. Finally, they reached the edge of the forest and Aleksy's village came into view. The woman breathed a sigh of relief. Aleksy led her to his house and went inside to get his wife. "Martha, I found this woman on the mountain. She's been lost for hours and she's hungry and cold. Can we help her?" Martha nodded and beckoned for the woman to come inside. She led her to the kitchen and sat her down at the table. Then she began to prepare a hot meal for her. Aleksy sat with the woman while she ate, and Martha listened as she told her story. When she was finished, Martha said, "You're welcome to stay here for the night. Aleksy will show you to a room where you can sleep." The woman thanked them both and Aleksy showed her to a room upstairs. Then he went back downstairs to sit with Martha by the fire. "That was a kind thing you did, Aleksy," Martha said. "Not everyone would have helped a stranger like that." Aleksy shrugged. "I just did what anyone would do in a situation like that." Martha smiled and took his hand. "You're a good man, Aleksy. I'm glad I married you." Aleksy squeezed her hand and leaned in to kiss her. "I'm glad I married you too, Martha."
