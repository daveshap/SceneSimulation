Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Gabbi finishes her last job of the day, babysitting for a family with two young kids. It's been a long day, and she's ready to go home and relax. She gathers her things and heads for the door, but before she can reach it, she hears a noise coming from the other side. It sounds like someone is trying to break in. Gabbi quickly grabs a nearby lamp and hides behind the door, heart racing. She waits for a few moments, but the noise doesn't stop. It sounds like the person is getting closer. Just as the person is about to reach the door, Gabbi swings the lamp at them, knocking them out cold. She then calls the police and waits for them to arrive.
