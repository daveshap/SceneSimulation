Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Aleksy is standing in the middle of a concert, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He feels out of place and uncomfortable, and is just trying to get through the evening without drawing too much attention to himself.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy shuffles self-consciously from foot to foot, wishing he could disappear into the crush of bodies around him. The music is so loud that it feels like it's vibrating through his whole body, and the bright lights are almost painfully dazzling. He can see people dancing and singing all around him, and feels a pang of envy at their seeming carelessness. Suddenly, someone bumps into him from behind, sending him stumbling forward. He manages to catch himself before he falls, but his heart is pounding in his chest. He turns around to see who bumped into him, but the person has already melted back into the crowd. Aleksy takes a deep breath and tries to still his racing heart. He tells himself that he can get through this evening, even if it feels like torture. He just has to keep moving and eventually the night will be over.
