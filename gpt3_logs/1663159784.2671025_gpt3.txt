Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Aleksy is sitting at a small, round table in his quaint country cottage, enjoying a simple lunch of bread and cheese. The sun is streaming in through the open windows, and a warm breeze is wafting through the room. All is peaceful and quiet. Suddenly, Aleksy hears a loud crash outside. He jumps up from his chair and runs to the window to see what's going on. He sees a large truck careening off the road and crashing into a tree just a few yards from his cottage. Aleksy rushes outside to see if he can help. He finds the driver of the truck unconscious and bleeding badly. He quickly goes back inside and calls for an ambulance. While he's waiting, Aleksy does what he can to help the injured driver, using his first aid training to staunch the flow of blood and keep the man comfortable. Soon, the ambulance arrives and takes the driver to the hospital. Aleksy is relieved that he was able to help, but shaken by the incident.
