Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's a dark, moonless night, and Gabbi is babysitting her two young charges in a remote cabin deep in the forest. It's been a long night, and the kids are finally asleep. Gabbi is just about to settle down with a book when she hears a strange noise outside the cabin. She gets up to investigate, and sees a large, furry creature lurking in the shadows. The creature is watching her with its glowing yellow eyes, and Gabbi can see that it's covered in blood. She realizes that it's a werewolf, and she's in serious trouble. The werewolf lashes out at her, but Gabbi is able to dodge its attack. She grabs the children and runs into the woods, the werewolf close behind her. Gabbi is a fast runner, but the werewolf is gaining on her. She knows she can't outrun it, so she looks for somewhere to hide. She finds a large tree with a hollow trunk, and she scrambles inside, pulling the kids in with her. The werewolf howls in frustration outside the tree, but it can't get to them. Gabbi knows they're safe for now, but she knows the werewolf will be back. She has to find a way to kill it before that happens.
