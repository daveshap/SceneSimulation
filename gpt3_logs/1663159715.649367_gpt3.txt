Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The concert is in full swing, with the band playing their hearts out on stage. The crowd is cheering and dancing along, waving their hands in the air. Wang is standing in the middle of it all, holding a box of pizza. He's looking around, trying to figure out where he's supposed to deliver it. Suddenly, someone bumps into him from behind and the pizza goes flying. Wang turns around to see a guy stumbling away, laughing. He's obviously drunk. Wang is angry, but there's nothing he can do. He turns back to the pizza, which is now lying in the dirt. He sighs and bends down to pick it up. At that moment, he notices a girl standing off to the side, watching him. She's got a kind smile on her face. Wang feels a little embarrassed, but he smiles back at her. Then he turns and heads back to his truck, pizza in hand.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The girl watches Wang as he walks away, still smiling. She's curious about him and decides to follow him. Wang doesn't notice her as he walks back to his truck and puts the pizza box in the back. He's about to get in when the girl speaks up. "That was a pretty rough fall you took back there," she says. Wang turns and looks at her. He's surprised that she noticed. "Yeah, I guess it was," he says. "You're lucky that pizza box didn't break," she says. "If it had, you would have been covered in cheese and tomato sauce." Wang laughs. "Yeah, that would have been a mess," he says. The girl smiles. "I'm sorry about that guy bumping into you," she says. "Some people just don't know how to have fun." "It's all right," Wang says. "I'm just glad the pizza is okay." "So are you delivering pizzas tonight?" the girl asks. "Yeah, I am," Wang says. "I just finished my shift, actually." "That's cool," the girl says. "I'm sure a lot of people are happy to get their pizzas on time." "I hope so," Wang says. "I'm just doing my job, you know?" "Well, I think you're doing a great job," the girl says. Wang blushes. "Thanks," he says. "I appreciate that." The girl smiles. "I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name," she says. "It's Wang," he says. "What about you?" "I'm Lily," she says. "Nice to meet you, Lily," Wang says. "You too, Wang," she says. They stand there for a moment, smiling at each other. Then Lily looks at her watch. "I should probably get going," she says. "It was nice meeting you." "Yeah, you too," Wang says. Lily turns and starts to walk away. Wang watches her for a moment, then gets in his truck and drives off.
