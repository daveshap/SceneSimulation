Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is a construction worker who is working on a building in a brightly lit city. It is early in the morning, and he is using a crane to move some materials around. He is working on the top of the building, and he has a great view of the city. He can see all of the people below him, and he can see the buildings and cars. He is wearing a hard hat and a safety harness, and he is working carefully.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn is working diligently when he suddenly hears a faint scream coming from the street below. He looks down and sees a woman being mugged. He does not hesitate to jump into action. He climbs down the crane as quickly as he can and jumps to the ground, running to the woman's aid. He tackles the mugger and punches him repeatedly until he is unconscious. The woman is crying and shaking, and Mashawn comforts her until the police arrive.
