Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is a delivery driver who has just arrived on the moon. He is driving his truck through the lunar landscape, making his way to the delivery site. The moon is a dark and desolate place. There is no atmosphere and the only light comes from the stars and the planets. Wang's truck is the only light in the darkness. As he drives, Wang can see the craters and mountains in the distance. He is getting closer to his destination. The delivery site is a small, isolated base on the side of a mountain. There are no lights or signs of life. Wang pulls up to the base and gets out of his truck. He looks around and sees no one. He begins to unload the boxes of supplies from his truck. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Someone is coming. Wang hides behind a box and waits. A figure appears in the darkness. It is a human. The person is wearing a space suit and carrying a rifle. The figure approaches Wang and points the rifle at him. Wang is terrified. The figure speaks in a voice that is distorted by the helmet. "What are you doing here?" Wang is too scared to speak. The figure repeats the question. Wang finally responds. "I'm just making a delivery." The figure lowers the rifle. "Sorry, I thought you were someone else. I'm the base commander. Welcome to the moon."

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang is relieved that the figure is not an enemy. He follows the base commander into the base. The commander shows Wang around. There are several small rooms and a common area. The base is very basic. There are no windows and the only light comes from fluorescent bulbs. Wang helps the commander unload the boxes. They are supplies for the base. The commander tells Wang that he and his team are the only humans on the moon. They are there to research the moon's surface. Wang is amazed that he is the first person to meet humans on the moon. The commander offers to show Wang around the base. Wang is happy to see the sights. He is fascinated by the moon and the view from the base. The commander shows Wang to his room. Wang is tired from his long journey. He thanks the commander and goes to bed.
