SCENE: The sun is barely visible through the thick trees, casting a dappled light on the forest floor. Sandy is picking her way carefully through the undergrowth, her eyes darting around for any signs of danger. She is on edge, aware that this is not a safe place for a woman alone. Suddenly, she hears a rustling in the bushes ahead of her and her heart sinks. She knows she is not alone in this place anymore. Tentatively, she takes a few steps forward, peering into the darkness. And then she sees it. A huge, furry creature is standing in front of her, its yellow eyes boring into her soul. She knows she is in danger now. Slowly, she backs away, her heart pounding in her chest. The creature follows her, stalking her like prey. She knows she is not going to make it out of this alive.

==========

Sandy's heart is pounding in her chest as she backs away from the huge, furry creature in front of her. She knows she is in danger now, and she knows she is not going to make it out of this alive. The creature follows her, stalking her like prey. Sandy is terrified, and she knows she doesn't stand a chance against this creature. She backs up against a tree, and the creature is upon her in an instant. Sandy screams as the creature sinks its teeth into her flesh. She feels the sharp pain as the creature's teeth rip through her skin. She struggles to free herself, but the creature is too strong. Sandy feels her life force slipping away as she is consumed by the creature. There is nothing she can do but accept her fate.
