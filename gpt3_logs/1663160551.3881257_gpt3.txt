SCENE: Jenna was in her office building, working on some homework. It was getting dark outside, and she was starting to get tired. She decided to take a break and went to the window to look out. The office building was in the city, and she could see the lights of the skyline. The sun was setting, and the sky was a beautiful orange. She watched the people walking on the street below and the cars driving by. She felt a sudden jolt and realized that the building was shaking. She heard screams and people running. She grabbed her backpack and ran out of the office. The building was collapsing. Jenna ran as fast as she could, but the debris was falling all around her. She was hit by a piece of concrete and knocked to the ground. She tried to get up, but she couldn't move. She was trapped.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna lay on the ground, trying to catch her breath. She could hear the sound of the building collapsing all around her and the screams of the people who were still inside. She was in pain and could feel a warm liquid running down her face. She reached up and felt her head, and her hand came away covered in blood. She tried to move, but her leg was trapped under a piece of debris. She was trapped and injured, and she knew she wasn't going to be able to get out on her own. She lay there for a while, waiting for someone to come and help her. She could feel herself getting weaker and she knew she was going to pass out soon. She thought about her family and how she was never going to see them again. She said a prayer and then everything went black.
