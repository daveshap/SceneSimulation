She's been enjoying her time at home with her kids, but it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Everything is quiet and peaceful, until Sandy's phone rings. She looks at it, and she sees that it's her husband. She answers it, and he starts to tell her about his day. But Sandy is no longer interested in hearing about her husband's day. She's more interested in the view from her mountaintop. She tells him she has to go, and she hangs up the phone. Sandy is now alone on the mountaintop, and she is enjoying the peace and quiet.
