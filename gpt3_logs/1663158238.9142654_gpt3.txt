Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting, and the stage is illuminated in a warm, golden light. The crowd is cheering and Sandy is standing in the middle of it all, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. She feels happy and free, and she can't help but dance along with the rest of the crowd. The music is loud and Sandy can feel the bass vibrating through her body. She closes her eyes and lets herself get lost in the moment. She's swaying her hips and moving her arms in time with the music, and she's lost in the rhythm. She's surrounded byhappy people, and she feels like she's in the best place in the world.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy is suddenly pulled out of her reverie by a tap on her shoulder. She turns to see one of the security guards from the festival. He's looking at her sternly and she wonders what she's done wrong. The guard motions for her to follow him and she reluctantly does. Sandy is led backstage, where she is met by the festival organizer. He tells her that she's been dancing too close to the stage and she needs to be more careful. Sandy apologized and is allowed to go back to the crowd. She's embarrassed but tries to brush it off and enjoy the rest of the festival.
