Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is walking through the dark forest, early in the morning. She is carrying a large basket of laundry on her head. She is also carrying her two-year-old daughter, Mia, on her back. Sandy is wearing a long, brightly colored dress and a scarf around her head. She is singing softly to herself as she walks. Suddenly, Sandy hears a noise in the bushes. She stops and listens, but she doesn't see anything. She starts to walk again, but the noise gets louder. This time, she sees a large snake slithering towards her. Sandy screams and tries to run away, but the snake is too fast. It wraps itself around her leg and starts to squeeze. Sandy falls to the ground, still screaming. Mia starts to cry. Sandy tries to reach for her daughter, but the snake is constricting her body. She can't move. The snake tightens its grip and Sandy stops screaming. Her body goes limp and she dies. Mia continues to cry, until she finally falls asleep from exhaustion.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy's lifeless body lies on the ground, her eyes wide open and unseeing. The snake is still wrapped around her, its body now swollen with Sandy's blood. Mia sits beside her mother's body, crying and trying to wake her up. She doesn't understand what has happened and why her mother isn't moving. After a while, Mia's cries start to fade as exhaustion takes over. She curls up next to her mother's body and falls asleep. The sun rises slowly, casting a faint light over the forest. Sandy's body is starting to stiffen and the color is draining from her skin. Mia is still asleep, her head pillowed on Sandy's chest. A small fly lands on Sandy's open eye and starts to crawl around. Mia stirs and slowly opens her eyes. She sees the fly on her mother's face and brushes it away. She looks around, confusion and fear etched on her little face. Sandy's body is cold and there is a strange smell in the air. Mia starts to cry again, her sobs echoing in the silence of the forest.
