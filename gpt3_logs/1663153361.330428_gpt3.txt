Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The early morning sun casts a pale glow over the barren landscape of the moon. Aleksy, a grocery store clerk, is taking his regular morning walk, enjoying the tranquility of the morning. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise behind him. He turns around to see a large object hurtling towards him at high speed. He has just enough time to register the fear on his face before the object hits him, sending him flying through the air. Aleksy crashes to the ground, unconscious. He is bleeding heavily from a head wound. The impact has caused his helmet to crack, and his oxygen supply is leaking out. If he doesn't get help soon, he will die.
