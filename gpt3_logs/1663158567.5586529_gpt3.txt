Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang climbs the last few feet to the mountaintop, gasping for breath in the thin air. He pauses to rest, leaning against a boulder, and looks out over the valley below. The sun is setting, and the sky is turning a deep red. Wang shivers and pulls his jacket tighter around him. He looks down at his watch and curses. He's running late. He has to deliver a package to the monastery on the other side of the mountain, and it's already getting dark. Wang knows the monks don't like visitors after dark, but he has no choice. He starts down the path, picking his way carefully in the twilight. As he approaches the monastery, he can see lights shining in the windows. He quickens his pace, but before he can reach the door, it swings open and a figure cloaked in black appears. Wang stops in his tracks, heart pounding. The figure beckons to him, and Wang hesitantly follows. He is led into the monastery, where he is greeted by the abbot. The abbot tells Wang that he has been expecting him. Wang is relieved, and the abbot leads him to the dining hall, where a warm meal is waiting. After dinner, the abbot shows Wang to his room and tells him to get some rest. Wang is tired from his long journey, and he quickly falls asleep. In the morning, he will be given the package to deliver.

"You have a long journey ahead of you, Wang. Are you sure you're up for it?" Wang nods, his mouth full. He finishes eating and wipes his face with a napkin. "I'm ready," he says. The abbot nods and hands him a small package. "You must deliver this to the monastery on the other side of the mountain. It is very important." Wang takes the package and puts it in his pocket. He stands up and thanks the abbot for his hospitality. Then he picks up his pack and starts down the path. The sun is high in the sky now, and Wang is getting tired.
