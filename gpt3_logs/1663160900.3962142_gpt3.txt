Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob is standing in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He's holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a book in the other, and he looks like he's enjoying himself immensely. He's tapping his foot along to the beat and swaying slightly from side to side, and every now and then he takes a sip of his coffee. He's clearly in his element here, surrounded by the music and the people.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob is still standing in the middle of the concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He's still holding his cup of coffee in one hand and his book in the other, and he looks like he's still enjoying himself immensely. He's still tapping his foot along to the beat and swaying slightly from side to side, and every now and then he takes another sip of his coffee. He's clearly still in his element here, surrounded by the music and the people. The only difference now is that Bob has started to bob his head along to the beat of the music, and he's swaying his hips a bit more than before. He looks like he's really enjoying himself, and he's got a big smile on his face.
