SCENE: The sun beats down on the savannah, August heat bearing down on the land.

The beans and rice are a welcome relief from the heat, and the group chat and laugh as they eat. Bob is the owner of the local coffee shop, and he takes a moment to enjoy the company of his friends before getting back to work.
