SCENE: Jenna had always loved hiking, and when she found out her family would be spending a summer in Europe, she was determined to explore as many mountain trails as possible. So far, she had climbed some of the largest peaks in the Alps, and today she was setting her sights on one of the smaller ones. The sun was starting to set by the time Jenna reached the top of the mountain, but she wanted to enjoy the view for a little while longer before starting her descent. She sat down on a large rock and took in the sight of the valley below, the sleepy villages nestled among the rolling hills. It was so peaceful up here, Jenna thought to herself. She could understand why people loved to come to the mountains to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. After a few minutes, she got up and started to make her way back down the trail. She had only gone a few steps when she heard a rustling in the bushes. Jenna froze, her heart pounding in her chest. Could it be a wild animal? She didn't know if there were any dangerous animals in these mountains, but she didn't want to take any chances. Slowly, she started to back away from the bushes, but before she could get too far, a man stepped out from behind them. Jenna gasped and took a step back. The man was holding a knife, and he had a sinister look in his eyes. Jenna knew she was in trouble. There was no one around for miles, and she didn't know how to defend herself against a knife. She tried to think of something, anything, that could help her get out of this situation, but her mind was blank. The man took a step towards her, and Jenna stepped back again. She knew she was going to have to think of something fast.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The man took another step towards Jenna, and she stepped back again. She was now backed up against a tree, and there was nowhere else to go. The man was still holding the knife, and Jenna could see the look of hunger in his eyes. She knew she was in trouble. There was no one around for miles, and she didn't know how to defend herself against a knife. She tried to think of something, anything, that could help her get out of this situation, but her mind was blank. The man took another step closer, and Jenna could feel the tree trunk pressing into her back. She knew she had to think of something fast. Suddenly, she remembered something her father had taught her when she was younger. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this, he had said, use your words. Talk to the person and try to reason with them. Jenna knew it was a long shot, but she had to try something. "Please," she said, her voice shaking. "Don't hurt me. I don't have anything worth stealing." The man just laughed and took another step closer. Jenna could see the hunger in his eyes, and she knew he wasn't going to just let her go. She had to think of something fast. "Please," she said again. "There's no need to do this. I won't tell anyone. Just let me go and I'll forget this ever happened." The man just laughed again and took another step closer. Jenna was now backed up against the tree with nowhere to go. She knew she had to think of something fast. Suddenly, she remembered what her father had said about using your words. "Please," she begged. "There's no need to do this. I won't tell anyone. Just let me go and I'll forget this ever happened." The man just laughed again, but this time he took a step back. Jenna could see the hunger in his eyes, but she could also see the hesitation. "Please," she begged again. "Just let me go and I'll forget this ever happened. I promise." The man hesitated for a moment, and then he finally took a step back. Jenna could see the hunger in his eyes, but she also saw the fear. He was afraid of getting caught. "Yes," he said finally. "Just go and forget this ever happened." Jenna didn't need to be told twice. She turned and ran as fast as she could back down the mountain trail. She didn't stop running until she reached the safety of the village below.
