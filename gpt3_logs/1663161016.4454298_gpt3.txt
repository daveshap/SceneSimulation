SCENE: Bob is walking through the dark forest in South America, middle of the night. He is walking quickly, and seems to be looking for something. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He turns around to see a large, furry creature standing there, growling at him. Bob backs away slowly, tripping over a log and falling to the ground. The creature comes closer, towering over him. Bob feels paralyzed with fear and can't move. He feels the creature's hot breath on his face as it leans in closer...

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The creature leans in closer, its hot breath making Bob's skin crawl. He can see its sharp teeth glinting in the moonlight and its eyes boring into his. He feels paralyzed with fear and can't move. The creature opens its mouth wide and moves in for the kill. Just then, Bob's hand involuntarily twitches and he feels a sharp pain in his side. He looks down to see the creature's teeth sunk into his flesh. He screams in pain as the creature starts to drag him away into the darkness. Bob knows he is going to die unless he does something. He summon all his strength and manages to grab hold of a tree root with his free hand. He tries to hold on as the creature pulls him, but the root starts to give way. Bob knows he only has one chance. He lets go of the root and grabs hold of the creature's fur with both hands. He hangs on for dear life as the creature continues to drag him through the forest. Suddenly, the creature stops and Bob hears it give a loud roar. He looks up to see another creature standing in front of them, blocking their path. The two creatures start to fight, giving Bob the opportunity he needs to escape. He slowly inch his way back, trying not to make any noise. When he feels he is far enough away, he gets to his feet and starts to run. He doesn't look back until he reaches the safety of his campsite.
