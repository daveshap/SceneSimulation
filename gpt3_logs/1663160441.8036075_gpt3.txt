Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The bedroom is slightly messy, with toys strewn about the floor and clothes thrown over a chair in the corner. It's clear that a young child lives here. Gabbi, the babysitter, is sitting on the edge of the bed, reading a book to the child who is sitting next to her. Every so often, the child interrupts her to ask a question or make a comment, and Gabbi patiently answers. As the sun starts to set, Gabbi starts to wind down the story. The child protests at first, but Gabbi assures them that they can finish the book tomorrow. She tucks the child into bed, and they say their goodnights. Gabbi turns off the light and heads to the door, but not before giving the child one last reassuring pat on the back.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi is in the process of leaving the child's bedroom when she suddenly hears a loud noise coming from downstairs. She freezes for a moment, unsure of what to do. Should she investigate the noise or stay put in the child's room? Gabbi decides to investigate the noise and quietly leaves the child's room, making sure to leave the door slightly ajar in case she needs to make a quick escape. As she cautiously makes her way downstairs, she hears the noise again, this time coming from the kitchen. She slowly enters the kitchen, but there's nobody there. She looks around for a possible source of the noise, but she can't seem to find anything. Suddenly, the noise sounds again, but this time it's coming from outside. Gabbi goes to the window and looks out, but she doesn't see anything. She's about to go back upstairs when she hears the noise again, but this time it sounds like it's coming from the child's room. Gabbi runs back upstairs and enters the child's room, but there's nobody there. She looks around the room, but she can't find anything out of the ordinary. Suddenly, she hears the noise again, but this time it sounds like it's coming from outside the window. She goes to the window and looks out, but she still doesn't see anything. Gabbi is starting to feel a bit uneasy. She's not sure what's causing the noise, but it seems to be coming from all around her. She decides to go back downstairs and call the child's parents to let them know what's going on. When she gets downstairs, she tries to call the parents, but there's no answer. She starts to feel a bit panicky now. She's not sure what to do. Should she stay put or try to find a way to escape?
