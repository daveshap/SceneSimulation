SCENE: The sun was high in the sky and the waves were crashing against the shore as Swathi sat on the beach, enjoying her lunch. She had been working hard on her latest project and wanted to take a break to clear her head. The sound of the waves and the feel of the sand between her toes was just what she needed. As she sat there, she watched as a group of children played in the water, laughing and splashing around. It was a beautiful day and she was happy to be able to enjoy it.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sound of the waves grew louder and Swathi felt the sand shifting beneath her as the tide came in. She watched as the children ran back to the shore, their laughter carrying on the wind. The sun was still high in the sky, but the waves were now crashing against the rocks, sending spray into the air. Swathi sat for a while longer, letting the sound of the waves wash over her. Eventually, she got up and brushed the sand off her legs. It was time to get back to work.
