SCENE: Jenna is walking through a dark forest in South America. She is walking quickly, and her heart is pounding. She is looking around nervously, as if she is expecting something to jump out at her. She is carrying a large bag over her shoulder, and she is sweating profusely. She keeps glancing over her shoulder, as if she is being followed. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap. She freezes in her tracks and looks around wildly. She sees a large, dark shape moving towards her. She opens her mouth to scream, but before she can make a sound, the dark shape is upon her.
