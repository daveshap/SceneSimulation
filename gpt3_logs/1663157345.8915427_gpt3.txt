Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as Gabbi arrives at the cottage. She unlocks the door and steps inside, taking a moment to appreciate the peacefulness of the place. Everything is tidy and well-kept, with a homey feel that makes her feel immediately at ease. She sets down her bag and goes to check on the children, finding them both fast asleep in their beds. With a smile, she goes about her morning routine of getting breakfast ready and tidying up the house. Outside, the birds are singing and the flowers are just starting to bloom. It's shaping up to be a beautiful day, and Gabbi can't help but feel grateful to be able to spend it in such a lovely place.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi finishes up her morning routine, then heads outside to enjoy the beautiful day. She takes a stroll around the property, admiring the flowers and the peacefulness of the countryside. After a while, she sits down on the porch swing and closes her eyes, letting the warm sun wash over her. She must doze off for a while, because the next thing she knows, she hears the sound of children laughing. She opens her eyes to see two little girls running around the yard, playing tag. They spot Gabbi and come running over, asking if she'll play with them. Gabbi happily agrees, and they spend the next hour or so playing games and chasing each other around. It's just what she needed to relax and forget about her troubles for a while.
