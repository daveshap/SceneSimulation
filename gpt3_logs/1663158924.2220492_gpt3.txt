Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Tom walks through the dark forest, carrying a lantern in one hand and a machete in the other. He's been walking for hours, and he's getting tired. The only sound is the crunching of leaves under his feet. He's getting worried - he's lost his way. Tom stops and looks around. He can't see anything in the darkness. He's about to give up and sit down when he hears a noise. It sounds like someone is crying. He follows the sound until he comes to a clearing. In the center of the clearing is a small mound of dirt. Tom sets down his lantern and machete and starts to dig. After a few minutes, he uncovers a small child, huddled in a fetal position. The child is crying and shaking with fear. Tom picks him up and tries to comfort him. The child is scared and won't stop crying. Tom doesn't know what to do. He looks around the clearing and sees a small hut. He takes the child to the hut and sets him down on a bed. He then goes back outside to get his things. When he comes back inside, he sees the child lying on the bed, fast asleep. He's relieved and happy that he was able to help.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom looks down at the sleeping child and wonders how he ended up in this situation. He's never been good with kids, but he knows he has to do something. He can't just leave the child here alone. He looks around the hut and sees a few items that might be useful. He starts rummaging through the belongings and finds a blanket, a pillow, and some clothes. He sets these items down on the bed and tries to think of what to do next. He knows he can't take the child with him, but he also can't just leave him here. He decides to wait until morning and see if he can find help. He doesn't want to leave the child alone, so he sits down in a chair next to the bed and watches over him.
