SCENE: Tom was tending to the bar when he heard a knock at the door. He went to answer it and found a beautiful woman standing before him. She introduced herself as Sarah and said she was looking for a place to stay for the night. Tom told her she was welcome to stay at the cottage and showed her to a room. Sarah was tired from her journey and went to lie down. Tom got her a glass of water and left her to rest. As he was walking back to the bar, he heard a scream coming from Sarah's room. He ran to her and found her lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Tom quickly called for help, but it was too late. Sarah had been stabbed to death.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom was in shock as he stared at Sarah's lifeless body. He couldn't believe what had happened. He heard a noise behind him and turned to see the killer standing in the doorway. The killer smiled as they raised their bloodied knife. Tom tried to run, but the killer was too quick. They stabbed him in the back and he fell to the ground. The last thing Tom saw was the killer's satisfied smile as they walked away.
