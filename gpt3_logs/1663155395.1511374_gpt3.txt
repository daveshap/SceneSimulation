Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun is setting and the sky is turning a deep shade of pink and orange. The birds are singing and the breeze is blowing through the trees. All is peaceful and tranquil. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. A car pulls up to the cottage and a young woman, Swathi, gets out. She looks around for a moment, taking in the peaceful surroundings, before making her way to the front door. She enters the cottage and is greeted by the smell of freshly baked bread. She follows the smell to the kitchen, where she finds a warm loaf of bread waiting for her. She smiles and takes a bite, savoring the flavor. After a few minutes, she sets the bread down and wanders into the living room. She flops down onto the comfortable sofa and lets out a sigh of contentment. It feels good to be home.
