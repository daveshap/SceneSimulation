Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Bob straightens the last of the chairs and steps back to survey his handiwork. His coffee shop looks inviting, with its soft lighting and comfortable chairs. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee hangs in the air, tantalizing customers as they walk by. Bob is nervous. This is his first day open for business, and he doesn't know if anyone will come. He knows there are other coffee shops in the area, but he's hopeful that his will be the one that stands out. He takes a deep breath and goes to the counter to wait for customers.
