Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting, and the last of its rays are streaming through the window. The room is cast in a warm, orange glow. Mashawn is in the process of getting ready for bed. He's changed into his pajamas and is now brushing his teeth at the sink. He spits into the sink and rinses his mouth out with water. He then takes a few swigs from a bottle of water before setting it back down on the counter. He walks over to the bed and climbs in. He reaches over to the bedside table and turns off the lamp. The room is now plunged into darkness. He settle down into the bed and close his eyes, ready to drift off to sleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The room is dark and Mashawn is already asleep. Suddenly, a bright light shines through the window, casting the room in a eerie glow. Mashawn stirs in his sleep but does not wake up. The light grows brighter and brighter until it's almost blinding. Mashawn covers his eyes with his arm, trying to block out the light. A loud rumble echoes through the room and the ground starts to shake. Mashawn wakes up with a start and sits up in bed, wide-eyed with terror. The room is shaking and items are falling off the shelves. The lamp falls off the bedside table and shatters on the floor. Mashawn scramble out of bed and tries to make his way to the door, but he trips and falls to the ground. The shaking gets worse and the room starts to collapse around him. Mashawn screams as he's buried alive beneath the rubble.
