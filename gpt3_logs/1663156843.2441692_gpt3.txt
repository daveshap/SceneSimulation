Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is beginning to set in the sky, painting the African landscape in a beautiful array of oranges, pinks and yellows. Gabbi is sitting on the veranda of the house she is babysitting in, watching the children play in the garden. She smiles as she watches them chasing each other around, their laughter filling the air. As the sky grows darker, Gabbi starts to sing a lullaby to the children. They quickly settle down and come to sit with her, their eyes heavy with sleep. She continues to sing as they drift off to sleep, their heads resting on her lap. Once they are both asleep, Gabbi gently lays them down in their beds and tucks them in. She gives them both a kiss goodnight and quietly leaves the room, closing the door behind her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The moon is high in the sky, casting a soft light over the sleeping children. Gabbi is sitting in a chair next to their beds, watching them as they sleep. She smiles as she hears their soft breathing and the occasional snore from one of them. She knows that they are safe and sound in their beds and she can't help but feel grateful for that. As she sits there, she hears a noise coming from outside. She gets up to investigate and sees that the noise is coming from the garden. She quietly makes her way outside, trying not to make a sound. As she approaches the garden, she sees a figure moving around in the darkness. She can't see who it is, but she knows that they are up to no good. She quietly creeps up behind the figure and taps them on the shoulder. As they turn around, she gasps. She can't believe that it is the man who has been stalking her for the past few weeks.
