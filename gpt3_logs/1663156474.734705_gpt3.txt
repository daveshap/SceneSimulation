SCENE: Aleksy is strolling along the beach, enjoying the sunny day. He's carrying a picnic basket with some sandwiches and drinks, and he's looking forward to having a nice, peaceful lunch. As he approaches a quiet spot on the beach, he sees a beautiful woman sunbathing. She's wearing a skimpy bikini, and she's obviously not from around here. Aleksy can't help but stare at her. The woman notices Aleksy staring, and she smiles at him. Aleksy's heart skips a beat. He's never been this close to a woman like this before. He's not sure what to do. The woman sits up and starts talking to Aleksy in a foreign language. He can't understand a word she's saying, but he can tell she's being friendly. They chat for a few minutes before the woman stands up and walks away. Aleksy is amazed by what just happened. He can't believe he just had a conversation with a beautiful stranger. He's definitely going to remember this lunchtime beach experience for a long time to come.
