Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi arrived at her office building early in the morning, as she usually did. She was a software engineer and worked on developing new software for the company. As she entered the building, she greeted the security guard and made her way to the elevator. She pressed the button for her floor and waited patiently as the elevator ascended. Once she arrived at her floor, she walked down the hallway to her cubicle. She sat down and booted up her computer, ready to start her workday.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi spends the morning working on some new code for the company's software. She takes a break for lunch, eating at her desk while she continues to work. Around mid-afternoon, she starts to feel a bit tired and takes a quick nap. She wakes up a few minutes later and goes back to work. As the day comes to an end, Swathi packs up her things and says goodbye to her co-workers. She takes the elevator down to the lobby and exits the building. She walks to her car and drives home, arriving just as the sun is setting.
