SCENE: The sun had not yet risen, but the sky was aglow with a soft, pink light. Tom stood on the beach, looking out at the calm water. It was almost as if the world was holding its breath, waiting for the day to begin. Tom was a bartender and he loved his job. He loved the people he met and he loved the feeling of being surrounded by good vibes. But more than anything, he loved the feeling of being in nature. There was something about the ocean that made him feel at peace. He had come to this beach early this morning because he wanted to watch the sunrise. He had always been drawn to the ocean and he loved the peace that came with watching the sun rise over the horizon. As he watched the sky change color, he felt his own body change. He felt his muscles relax and his mind clear. For a few minutes, he forgot about everything else in the world and he just existed in this moment. And in that moment, he felt complete.
