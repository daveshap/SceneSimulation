Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow over the landscape. Tom had been up for hours already, getting the bar ready for the day. He washed glasses and polished the counter, making sure everything was just so. Now that everything was in place, he could finally sit back and relax for a bit. He leaned against the back wall of the bar, letting out a weary sigh. It had been a long night, and he was looking forward to a few hours of peace and quiet. Suddenly, the calm was broken by the sound of loud, shouting voices. Tom groaned and stepped out from behind the bar, just in time to see a group of men stumbling towards him, clearly drunk. He knew there was going to be trouble.
