SCENE: Mashawn is walking through the dark forest, his construction worker's hat providing little light. He is trying to find his way back to the camp site. It is getting dark and he is starting to feel lost. He hears something in the distance and starts to run. He is running towards the noise, which is getting louder and closer. He can see a light up ahead and thinks he has found his way back. As he gets closer, he realizes that the light is coming from a campfire. He can see people around the fire, and they are all looking at him. He starts to feel uneasy and decides to turn back the way he came. As he turns, he sees a large animal standing in his path. It is a jaguar, and it is looking right at him.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn stops in his tracks, frozen with fear at the sight of the jaguar. His heart is pounding in his chest and he can feel the sweat on his forehead. He knows he needs to turn and run the other way, but his body won't move. The jaguar starts to prowl closer, its eyes fixed on Mashawn. He can see the hunger in the animal's eyes and knows he is in trouble. Suddenly, the jaguar leaps at him, knocking him to the ground. Mashawn tries to scream, but the air is knocked out of him. He feels the jaguar's teeth sinking into his flesh and knows his end is near. There is a flash of light and then everything goes black.
