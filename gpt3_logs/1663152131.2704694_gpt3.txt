Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Gabbi sat on the edge of the bed, watching the two children sleeping soundly in their beds. It had been a long day, and she was grateful to finally have a moment to herself. She sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the peace and quiet, before she heard a noise coming from the hallway. She got up quietly, careful not to wake the children, and went to investigate. She saw the outline of a man standing in the shadow at the end of the hallway, and her heart started to race. She knew she should call the police, but she was frozen in fear. The man started to come towards her, and Gabbi backed up into the bedroom, her mind racing. She looked around for a weapon, anything she could use to defend herself, but there was nothing. The man was getting closer and closer, and Gabbi could see the murderous look in his eyes. She knew she was going to die. Just as the man was about to reach her, she heard the sound of sirens in the distance. The man hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran out the front door. Gabbi collapsed to the floor, shaking and crying with relief. The police had arrived just in time.
