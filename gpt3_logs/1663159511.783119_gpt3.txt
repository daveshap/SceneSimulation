Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna, a high schooler, is walking through a dark forest in South America early in the morning. She is walking quickly and nervously, looking around her constantly. She is carrying a small backpack and a flashlight. She hears something in the distance and starts to run.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna is running as fast as she can, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear the thing chasing her, crashing through the underbrush. It's getting closer and closer. She sees a clearing up ahead and sprints for it. She reaches the clearing and realizes too late that it's a dead end. She turns to face the thing, her heart in her throat. It's a huge, monstrous creature, covered in fur. It's eyes are glowing yellow, and it's dripping with saliva. It's coming for her, and she knows she's going to die.
