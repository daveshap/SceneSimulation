Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi is a software engineer who works long hours and often doesn't get home until late at night. Tonight, she finally arrives home around 11pm, exhausted from a long day at work. She enters her bedroom and immediately starts to undress, eager to get into bed and relax. As she begins to take her clothes off, she notices something strange in the room. There is a faint noise coming from the corner of the room. Swathi slowly approaches the corner, trying to see what is making the noise. As she gets closer, she realizes that there is a small, furry creature hiding in the shadows. The creature is a rat, and it looks terrified. It is shaking and its eyes are wide, as if it is terrified of something. Swathi has never seen a rat in her apartment before, and she is not sure what to do. She stands there for a moment, unsure of what to do. Should she try to catch the rat? Should she call animal control? Or should she just ignore it and go to bed? After a moment of deliberation, she decides to just ignore the rat and go to bed. She gets into bed and quickly falls asleep, exhausted from her long day. The rat is still hiding in the corner of the room, trembling in fear.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The next morning, Swathi wakes up and gets ready for her day. She doesn't notice the rat in the corner of the room as she goes about her morning routine. She brushes her teeth, washes her face, and gets dressed. She grabs her purse and keys and heads out the door. As she leaves, the rat comes out of its hiding place and begins to explore the room. It sniffing around, looking for food. It doesn't find anything, so it heads back into the corner and hides again. Swathi comes home that evening and the rat is still in the same spot. It watches as she moves around the room, getting ready for bed. She doesn't seem to notice it, so it continues to stay in its hiding spot. The next day, the rat is still in the room when Swathi leaves for work. It spends the day hiding in the corner, coming out only occasionally to explore. It doesn't find anything to eat, so it goes back into hiding. Swathi comes home that night and the rat is still there. She doesn't know what to do, so she just leaves it be and goes to bed. This pattern continues for a few more days. The rat doesn't find anything to eat and it becomes weaker and weaker. Swathi comes home one night and finds the rat lying in the corner, barely alive. It looks up at her with pleading eyes, as if begging for help. Swathi feels bad for the rat, so she decides to call animal control. They come and pick up the rat, and take it to a shelter where it can get the help it needs.
