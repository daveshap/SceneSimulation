Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Wang is a delivery driver who is currently making a delivery under the Eiffel Tower. It is early in the morning and the streets are relatively empty. Wang is driving a small delivery truck and is currently stopped at a red light. He is waiting to turn onto a side street that will take him to his final destination. He is a little bit nervous as he has never made a delivery to this particular address before. He is also nervous because he is not familiar with the area and he does not want to get lost. As he sits at the red light, he looks out the window at the Eiffel Tower. It is an imposing structure and he cannot help but feel a little bit awestruck. He has always wanted to visit the tower but he has never had the opportunity. He wonders if he will ever have the chance to see it up close. The light turns green and Wang proceeds to turn onto the side street. He is relieved to see that there are no other vehicles on the street. He is also relieved to see that the address he is looking for is clearly marked. He pulls up to the address and parks the truck. He takes a deep breath and prepares to make the delivery.
