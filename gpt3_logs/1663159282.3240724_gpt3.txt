Gabbi is babysitting a group of children, who are all running around and having a great time. She is keeping a close eye on them, making sure they don't get lost in the crowd. As the concert goes on, the children start to get tired and Gabbi starts to worry about them. She tries to keep them entertained by dancing with them and singing along to the music, but eventually they all fall asleep. Gabbi is relieved and happy that she was able to keep them safe and sound during the concert.

As the concert comes to an end, Gabbi starts to gather up the sleeping children. She is careful not to wake them as she lifts them into her arms and starts to make her way through the crowd. People are still dancing and singing, but Gabbi is focused on getting the children out of there safely. She is relieved when she finally makes it out of the crowd and into the fresh air. The children are still sound asleep as she carries them to their parents and hands them over. She says her goodbyes and heads home, feeling happy and exhausted after a long night.
