Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is in the middle of a concert, surrounded by her friends. The music is blaring and the crowd is cheering. Jenna is dancing and singing along, having the time of her life. She's wearing her favorite band shirt and ripped jeans, and she has a glowstick in each hand. She's completely in the moment, lost in the music.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The music changes to a slower song and Jenna's friends start to pair up, leaving her alone. She tries to enjoy the music, but she feels a bit left out and awkward standing there by herself. She starts to head towards the exit, but someone grabs her hand and pulls her back. She looks up to see a tall, handsome stranger who starts to slow dance with her. She's a bit hesitant at first, but she gets lost in his eyes and ends up having a great time.
