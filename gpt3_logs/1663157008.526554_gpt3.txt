SCENE: The sky is a deep black, filled with stars. The moon is a bright, whitedisk, hanging low in the sky. Swathi is standing on the lunar surface,wearing a spacesuit. She is holding a laptop computer in one hand,and a cord in the other. The cord is attached to a satellite dish. Swathi is a software engineer. She works for a company that Develops software for the International Space Station. Swathi is also an amateur astronomer, and she is passionate about space exploration. This morning, Swathi is going to try to communicate with the International Space Station using her laptop and the satellite dish. She has never tried this before, and she is not sure if it will work. But she is hopeful that she will be able to establish a connection. Swathi turns on her laptop and starts to type. She enters a command that should direct the satellite dish to the International Space Station. Then she waits. After a few minutes, Swathi begins to lose hope. It doesn't seem like her laptop is doing anything. But then, all of a sudden, she sees a message on her screen. "Hello, Swathi. This is the International Space Station. We can hear you loud and clear." Swathi can't believe it. She has made contact with the International Space Station. She is ecstatic. She continues to talk to the astronauts on the space station, asking them about their work and their life in space. Swathi is having the time of her life. She knows that this is a moment that she will never forget.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The astronauts on the International Space Station are amazed that Swathi has been able to establish a communication link with them using only her laptop and a satellite dish. They eagerly answer all of her questions about their work and life in space. Swathi is thrilled to be able to talk to real astronauts and to learn about their experiences. She is especially interested in hearing about the challenges they face while living and working in space. After a while, the conversation starts to die down and Swathi realizes that she should probably let the astronauts get back to work. She says her goodbyes and thanks them for their time. Swathi is on Cloud Nine as she disconnects the satellite dish and starts to pack up her things. She can't believe that she was actually able to talk to the International Space Station. It is an experience that she will treasure forever.
