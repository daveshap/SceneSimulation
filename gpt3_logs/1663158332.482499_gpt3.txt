Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun was high in the sky and beating down on the sand which was hot to the touch. Gabbi was watching her two charges, Lila and Timo, as they played in the water. She made sure to keep a close eye on them as she knew that the ocean could be dangerous. The sound of laughter filled the air as the two children played with each other, making sand castles and chasing each other around. Gabbi kept a smile on her face as she watched them, but she was also on alert in case they needed her. After a while, the children started to get hungry so Gabbipack up their things and led them back to the beach house where they would have lunch.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi led the children back to the beach house, keeping a close eye on them as they ran and played. She knew they were hungry, so she decided to make them a quick lunch. She fixed them each a PB&J sandwich and cut up some apples for them to snack on. Timo and Lila sat at the table, munching on their lunch and laughing as they talked. Gabbi sat with them, making sure they ate enough before letting them go back to playing. Once they were finished, the children grabbed their things and ran back outside to play. Gabbi watched them for a while, making sure they were safe, before she went back inside to clean up lunch.
