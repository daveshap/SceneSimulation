Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting behind the mountains, and Gabbi is sitting on a bench, watching the clouds change color. She's been babysitting the kids all day, and they're finally asleep. She's tired, but she can't help but feel grateful for this moment of peace. The air is cool and fresh, and she can see the whole valley below. She takes a deep breath and lets her mind wander.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun continues to set, and Gabbi watches the sky change from a bright blue to a deep purple. She hears the sound of crickets chirping and the leaves rustling in the breeze. She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes, letting the peace of the moment wash over her. Suddenly, she hears a loud crash from inside the house. She jumps up, heart racing, and runs to the door. She opens it to find the kids have gotten out of bed and are running around, laughing and playing. Gabbi sighs in relief and shakes her head. It looks like her moment of peace is over.
