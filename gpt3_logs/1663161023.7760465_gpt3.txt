Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is on the moon, standing on the surface near the edge of a crater. She looks up at the sky, which is beginning to turn a deep blue. The stars are just starting to come out, and Jenna can see the Earth in the distance, a bright blue and white sphere hanging in the sky. Jenna is wearing a spacesuit, but she has removed her helmet and is breathing the air of the moon. She feels a sense of exhilaration being on the surface of the moon, and she can't help but to smile. Suddenly, Jenna hears a noise behind her and she turns around to see a large, dark object rising up out of the crater. Jenna's heart starts to race as she realizes that she is not alone on the moon.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

As Jenna turns around to see the large, dark object, her heart races and she start to feel anxious. She starts to back away slowly, not knowing what this object is or what it might do to her. The object continues to rise up out of the crater and Jenna can see that it is some kind of creature. It is large and black, with long limbs and a body that seems to be made of rock. Jenna is terrified as she backs away from the creature. She trips on a rock and falls to the ground, screaming. The creature looms over her, its large black body blocking out the stars and the moon. Jenna is too scared to move, and she simply lays there, whimpering in fear.
