SCENE: Mashawn is sitting on a bench in the park, enjoying his lunch break. The sun is shining and the birds are chirping. He people-watches for a while, enjoying the happy hustle and bustle of the city. He takes out his sandwich and takes a bite, savoring the deliciousness. He notices a group of children playing tag nearby, and he can't help but smile at their innocence. Suddenly, his phone rings, and he answers it. It's his boss, telling him that he's needed back on the job site. Mashawn sighs, but he knows he has to get back to work. He wraps up his lunch, says goodbye to the happy city scene, and heads back to the construction site.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn walks back to the construction site, his mind full of the happy scene he just left behind. He can't help but contrast it with the gritty reality of the construction site. The sun is still shining, but the construction workers are toiling away in the heat, their faces streaked with sweat and dust. Mashawn feels a pang of guilt as he thinks about how hard they must be working, while he was enjoying his lunch break. He knows he needs to get back to work, but he can't help but feel grateful for the happy moment he just experienced.
