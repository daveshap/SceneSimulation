Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sea is particularly rough tonight and the waves are crashing loudly against the shore. Mashawn is using a stick to draw patterns in the sand. He's not really paying attention to what he's doing, his mind is elsewhere. He's thinking about his wife and child back home and how much he misses them. He's only been away for a few weeks, but it feels like an eternity. Suddenly, he hears a noise from the direction of the trees. He stands up, alert and ready to defend himself, but relaxes when he sees that it's just a rabbit. The rabbit doesn't seem to be bothered by the noise and continues munching on some grass. Mashawn sits back down and goes back to his drawings. He's not sure what to make of the rabbit, but decides to leave it be.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn continues to draw in the sand, his mind now fully present as he tries to focus on the patterns he's creating. He hears the rabbit rustling in the grass again and wonders if it's coming closer. He's not sure why, but he suddenly feels very uneasy. He stands up and looks around, but doesn't see the rabbit anywhere. He starts to walk towards the trees, thinking that maybe the rabbit went that way. As he gets closer, he hears a branch snap. He freezes and listens, but doesn't hear anything else. He starts to back away slowly, but before he can take more than a few steps, he feels something hit him in the back of the head. He falls to the ground, unconscious.
