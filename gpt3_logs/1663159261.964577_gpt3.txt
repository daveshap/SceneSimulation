SCENE: Jenna is sitting on the beach, watching the sun rise. The sky is awash in a beautiful orange glow, and the waves are crashing against the shore. She's wrapped in a light blanket, and she feels peaceful and happy. She's been thinking a lot lately about what she wants to do with her life, and she's decided that she wants to travel the world. She's not sure how she'll make it happen, but she's determined to find a way. Sitting here on the beach, watching the sun rise, she feels like anything is possible.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna watched the sun for a few more minutes, letting the peace and happiness that she was feeling wash over her. She got to her feet, still wrapped in her blanket, and began to walk down the beach. The sand was cool and soft beneath her feet, and the sound of the waves was soothing. Jenna breathed in the salty air and felt her spirits lift. She knew that she could make her dream of traveling the world a reality; she just had to figure out how.
