Tom was in the middle of his lunch break, sitting at his desk in the office building where he worked. He was scrolling through his phone, when he heard a loud crash coming from the floor below. He got up to see what was going on and saw that a large chandelier had fallen from the ceiling and smashed onto the floor. People were screaming and running around in a panic. Tom quickly ran down the stairs to see if he could help. He saw that there were several people injured, and he started to help them to safety.
