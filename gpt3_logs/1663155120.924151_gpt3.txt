"Hey, babysitter! Come over here!" Gabbi ignores them and continues walking, but they follow her. "Come on, babysitter, we just want to talk to you." Gabbi quickens her pace, but they continue to follow her. Finally, she reaches her destination and runs up to the door, banging on it frantically. The teenager catch up to her and grab her arm. "Let me go! I have to babysit!" The teenager laugh and begin to drag her away. Gabbi screams for help, but no one comes. She is abducted by the teenagers and taken to an unknown location.
