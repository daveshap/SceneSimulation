Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Aleksy cautiously enters the forest, clutching a machete in one hand and a flashlight in the other. He'd been warned about this place by the locals - that it was dark, and deadly. And now, as he shone his light around, he could see why. The trees were close together, forming a canopy that blocked out most of the light. The ground was covered in a thick layer of leaves and twigs, making it difficult to see where he was stepping. Every sound he made echoed eerily through the trees. Aleksy had been walking for hours, and he was beginning to get tired and thirsty. He was debating whether to turn back when he heard a noise in the distance. It sounded like... music? He shone his light in the direction of the noise and started walking towards it. As he got closer, he could see a faint light shining through the trees. And then he heard it - laughter. He quickened his pace, and soon he came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a small campfire, and around the campfire were five figures, all dressed in strange clothes. They looked up as he approached. "Welcome, Aleksy," one of them said. "We've been expecting you."

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy hesitated before entering the clearing, one hand still clutching the machete tight. He shone his flashlight around, trying to get a better look at the figures seated around the campfire. They were all dressed in long, hooded cloaks, and their faces were hidden in the shadows. "Who are you?" he asked warily. "And how do you know my name?" "We know many things, Aleksy," the figure closest to him said. "We know that you're looking for your missing sister. And we know that you've been wondering why she disappeared." "What do you know about my sister?" demanded Aleksy. "Where is she?" "That's something you'll have to find out for yourself," said the figure. "If you want to know the truth, you'll have to come with us." Aleksy hesitated, then nodded. He didn't know what these people were, but if they knew something about his sister, he was willing to go with them. He followed them deeper into the forest, the machete still clutched in one hand. He had a feeling he was going to need it.
