Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is lying in her bed, wide awake. It's the middle of the night, and she can't seem to fall asleep. She tosses and turns, trying to get comfortable, but it's no use. She looks over at the alarm clock and sighs. 3:00 AM. She's been trying to sleep for hours now, but her mind just won't shut off. She gets out of bed and goes to the window, looking out at the darkened street below. She wonders what it would be like to just walk out of her house and start exploring the world. She's never been very adventurous, but the thought of just leaving everything behind is strangely appealing. She watches as a car drives by, its headlights illuminating the road for a moment before disappearing into the night. Jenna wonders what it's like to be out there, driving around with nowhere to go. She longs for something more, but she doesn't know what that is. She feels trapped in her life, like she's stuck in a rut. She knows she needs to make a change, but she doesn't know how. She stares out the window for a while, lost in thought, before finally going back to bed.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna lays in her bed for a few more minutes, contemplating her life and what she should do. She's restless and she can't seem to find a comfortable position. She gets out of bed and walks over to her dresser. She pulls out a pair of jeans and a shirt and gets dressed. She takes her phone and wallet off the nightstand and stuffs them into her pocket. She walks to her door and opens it, stepping out into the hallway. She's never done anything like this before, but she's fed up with her life. She's going to go out and find something more. She walks down the hallway and towards the front door. She can hear her parents snoring from their bedroom and she knows they won't wake up. She's never been a rebellious person, but she doesn't care anymore. She wants to experience life and she's not going to let anything stop her. She opens the front door and steps outside. She pauses for a moment, looking back at her house. She wonders if she'll ever see it again. She knows she needs to leave, but she can't help but feel a little sad. She takes a deep breath and starts walking down the street. She has no idea where she's going, but she knows she'll find something more out there.
