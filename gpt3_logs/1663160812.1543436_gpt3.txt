Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is sitting on a mountaintop in Europe, in the middle of the night. She is wearing a white gown and has a small group of people with her. Sandy is chanting and holding a crystal in her hand. The crystal is glowing brightly. Sandy's eyes are closed and she seems to be in a trance. The people with her are also chanting. They are all facing the same direction, towards the east.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy finishes her chant and opens her eyes. The crystal in her hand is now dull and lifeless. She looks around at the people with her, all of whom are now asleep. Sandy stands up and walks to the edge of the mountaintop. She looks out at the landscape below, all of which is cloaked in darkness. In the distance, she can see the lights of a city. Sandy takes a deep breath and jumps off the edge of the mountaintop.
