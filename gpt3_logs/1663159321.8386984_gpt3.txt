Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Sandy is in her bedroom, lying on the bed. She is wearing a loose fitting tank top and shorts. Her hair is pulled back in a messy bun and she has no makeup on. She looks tired and there are dark circles under her eyes. She is scrolling through her phone, mindlessly scrolling through social media. She comes across a post from a friend that shows her friend's happy family on vacation. Sandy's mood immediately changes and she feels a pang of jealousy. She puts her phone down and looks around her bedroom. It is a typical suburban bedroom with beige walls and a dresser with a mirror. There is a clothes hamper in the corner and a door that leads to a small bathroom. Sandy feels like she is trapped in this room. She gets up from the bed and goes to the window. She looks out the window and sees her neighbor's children playing in the yard. She watches them for a few minutes and then turns away from the window, her heart heavy with sadness.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Sandy continues to look around her room, her eyes landing on the clothes hamper in the corner. She walks over to it and starts to rummage through it, looking for something to wear. She pulls out a pair of jeans and a shirt and quickly gets dressed. She doesn't bother with her hair or makeup, she just wants to get out of the house. She walks to the door and opens it, stepping into the hallway. She can hear the sounds of her neighbor's children playing outside and it makes her heart ache. She starts to walk down the hallway, her mind racing with all of the things she wishes she had. She wishes she had a family of her own to take vacations with, she wishes she had a partner to come home to at the end of the day. As she walks, she notices pictures of her and her friends on the wall. She stops to look at them, a sad smile on her face. She remembers all of the good times they had together, but it only makes her feel worse. She eventually snaps out of it and continues down the hallway until she reaches the front door. She opens the door and steps outside, immediately being greeted by the sound of her neighbor's children playing. She can't take it anymore. She quickly turns and goes back inside, her heart heavy with sadness.
