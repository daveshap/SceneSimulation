The men on horseback surrounded the cottage and began pounding on the door. Tom shouted for them to go away, but they only laughed in response. The men threw themselves against the door, but Tom held it firm. Suddenly, one of the men broke through the window and leapt into the cottage. Tom reacted quickly, running him through with his sword.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The men on horseback quickly rode away, leaving Tom victorious. Tom breathed a sigh of relief and leaned against the door, still clutching his sword. His heart was pounding in his chest and he was trembling all over. He had never seen anything like that before. He had never been in a real fight before. The men had seemed so angry and determined to get into the cottage. He was sure they would have killed him if they had gotten through the door. He was glad he had been able to defend himself and the cottage. His customers were all safe in the back room. He would have to go check on them and make sure they were all right. Tom sheathed his sword and walked into the back room. His customers were all huddled together, shaking and terrified. Tom did his best to reassure them that they were safe now and that the men were gone. He told them they could come out now and they slowly began to trickle out of the room. Tom was glad he had been able to protect them, but he couldn't help but feel a little shaken himself.
