She can see for miles in every direction, the valleys and rivers shimmering in the early morning light. She can even see the tiny villages and farms dotting the landscape. Jenna is here on a school trip, and she's determined to make the most of it. She's already been up to the top of the mountain once, but she wanted to see the sunrise from here.
