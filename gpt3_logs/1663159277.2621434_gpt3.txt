Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is beginning to set as Wang makes his way up the winding mountain road. He's been driving for hours, and he's starting to feel fatigued. But he knows he has to press on - he has an important delivery to make. As he nears the top of the mountain, the road becomes even more treacherous. He has to concentrate hard to keep the truck from slipping off the edge. Finally, he reaches his destination. A large, imposing castle perched atop the mountain. He has to ring a bell to announce his arrival, and then he's met by a butler who leads him inside. Wang is led through a series of dark, winding corridors until he finally arrives at his destination: a large, ornate room with a huge fireplace. Waiting for him is his client, a wealthy businessman. The businessman inspects the package Wang has delivered, and then hands him a envelope of cash. Wang thanks him and then makes his way back out to the truck. He's relieved to be finished with the delivery, and he can't wait to get back down the mountain and back to civilization.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang climbs back into his truck, ready to head back down the mountain. He's exhausted from the long drive, and the narrow, winding road is treacherous in the dark. He takes a deep breath and starts the engine, making his way slowly down the mountain. He's concentrating hard, trying not to think about the sheer drop-off next to the road. Suddenly, he hears a loud bang. The truck lurches to the side and starts to careen off the road. Wang fights to keep control, but it's hopeless. The truck goes over the edge of the cliff and plummets into the darkness below.
