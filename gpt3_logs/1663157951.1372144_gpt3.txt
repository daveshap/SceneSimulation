Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna opens her bedroom door and steps inside. The room is a mess, with clothes and books strewn everywhere. She makes her way to the bed and flops down onto it, letting out a sigh. She lies there for a few moments, staring up at the ceiling. Then she sits up and starts picking up the clothes off the floor, putting them into a hamper. She neatens up the books on her desk and then flops back down onto the bed again. She picks up her phone and starts scrolling through social media. After a few minutes, she puts the phone down and gets up again. She goes over to her closet and starts looking through her clothes. She tries on a few outfits, standing in front of the mirror to see how they look. Finally, she settles on a pair of jeans and a shirt. She gets dressed and then sits back down at her desk. She starts working on her homework, but after a few minutes she gets distracted and starts playing on her phone again.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna's alarm goes off, blaring loudly in her ear. She slowly opens her eyes, groaning as she realizes it's time to get up for school. She sits up in bed, stretching her arms above her head. She gets out of bed and goes over to her dresser, pulling out a pair of jeans and a shirt. She gets dressed quickly, not bothering to look in the mirror. She grabs her backpack and phone off her desk and heads for the door. She stops in the doorway, taking one last look at her room. She sighs and shakes her head before stepping out into the hallway.
