SCENE: Aleksy had been walking for hours, and was now deep in the forest. He had been following a faint path, but it had long since disappeared. The light was fading fast, and Aleksy was starting to feel panic rising in him. He had no idea where he was, or how he was going to get out of the forest. Suddenly, Aleksy heard a noise in the bushes ahead of him. He froze, straining to see in the dim light. Then, out of the shadows, a huge cat emerged. Aleksy's heart raced as he watched the cat prowl towards him. The cat seemed to be stalking him, and Aleksy knew he was in serious trouble. He turned and ran the way he had come, but he had only gone a few steps when he heard the cat'sdeep, guttural growl behind him. Aleksy knew he was being hunted. The cat was getting closer and closer, and Aleksy's fear was paralysing him. He was about to be killed, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy felt the cat's breath on the back of his neck as it closed in for the kill. He knew he was about to die, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. The cat's claws dug into his flesh as it toppled him to the ground. Aleksy felt the sharp teeth sink into his neck, and he knew it was all over. There was a moment of pain, and then everything went black. Aleksy was dead.
