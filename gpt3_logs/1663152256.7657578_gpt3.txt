Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It's a beautiful day outside and the Eifel Tower looms large in the distance. Bob is busy serving coffee and pastries to his customers in his small shop when he notices a large group of tourists walking by. He knows that this is the lunch rush and he's prepared for it. He's got extra coffee and pastries on hand, and he's ready to serve his customers with a smile. He knows that many of them will be stopping by his shop to take a break from sightseeing and he wants to make sure they enjoy their time here. As the group approaches, he can see that they're all carrying cameras and maps, and he knows they're looking for a place to rest and refuel. He's ready to welcome them into his shop and give them the best service possible.
