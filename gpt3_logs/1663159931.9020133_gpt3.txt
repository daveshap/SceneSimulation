SCENE: It's 6pm and Wang, a delivery driver, is finishing up his shift. He's just made his last delivery of the day and is now heading back to the restaurant to drop off the van. As he walks into the bedroom, he notices that the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze. He also sees that the bed is unmade and there are clothes strewn about the room. Wang is about to close the window when he hears a noise coming from the other side of the room. He freezes, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, a woman comes into the room. She's wearing a robe and her hair is wet, like she's just gotten out of the shower. She sees Wang and starts to scream. Wang quickly closes the window and tries to calm her down. He explains that he's just a delivery driver and that he didn't mean to scare her. Eventually, the woman calms down and Wang is able to leave the room. As he's walking down the hall, he can hear the woman's screams echo in his mind.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The woman's screams echo in Wang's mind as he walks down the hall. He can't believe what just happened. He didn't mean to scare her, but he knows he must have looked like a burglar coming into her room. He feels terrible as he replay the scene in his head. He can still see the look of terror on her face. He knows he needs to apologize to her, but he's not sure if he should go back to the room or not. He decides to go back and knock on the door. When the woman opens the door, he can see that she's still shaken up. He apologizes profusely and she eventually accepts his apology. She thanks him for being honest and for not trying to hurt her. They both laugh nervously and Wang is finally able to leave the apartment.
