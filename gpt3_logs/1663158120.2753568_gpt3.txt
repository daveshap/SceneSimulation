Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the African plains, and Aleksy is getting ready to close up the grocery store for the night. He's been working all day, and he's exhausted. He's just about to lock the doors when he hears a loud noise outside. It sounds like someone is running towards the store. Aleksy unlocks the door and sees a man running towards him, followed by a pack of lions. The man is terrified and Aleksy knows he won't be able to outrun the lions. He's about to close the door and lock the man out when he sees the fear in the man's eyes. He can't just leave him to die. Aleksy yells for the man to come inside and runs to the back of the store to get a can of pepper spray. He's not sure if it will work on lions, but it's all he has. He sprays the lions as they come through the door and they start to back away. The man is safe, at least for now. Aleksy knows the lions will be back, so he locks the doors and prepares to defend the store all night.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun has disappeared behind the horizon, leaving the African plains in darkness. Aleksy is standing at the front of the store, peering out through the window. He's been standing there for hours, ever since he Pepper-sprayed the lions and they ran off. He knows they'll be back, and he's determined to defend the store. He's exhausted, but he can't afford to fall asleep. He heard the lions earlier, prowling around outside. They haven't made a move since then, but Aleksy knows they're out there, waiting to strike. Suddenly, Aleksy hears a loud crash. He looks over to see the lions bursting through the front door, trampling over the broken glass. Aleksy raises the can of pepper spray and starts spraying them, but it's no use. The lions are on him in seconds, knocking him to the ground. He feels their teeth sinking into his flesh and he knows he's about to die. There's nothing he can do to stop them. He closes his eyes and accepts his fate.
