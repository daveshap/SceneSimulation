Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Aleksy is working as a grocery store clerk on a busy lunchtime shift. He's been working hard all morning, and he's starting to feel pretty tired. He's just about to take his break when he sees a customer coming towards him. The customer, a young woman, looks around the store for a moment before coming up toAleksy. She seems a bit nervous, and Aleksy can see that she's holding a small, delicate object in her hand. The woman asks Aleksy for help in finding something, and Aleksy does his best to assist her. However, he can tell that she's still quite nervous, and he wonders what she's holding in her hand. Finally, the woman finds what she's looking for, and she thanks Aleksy before quickly leaving the store. Aleksy watches her go, curious about the object she was holding.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy's break time finally arrives, and he takes a seat on one of the benches in the park across the street from the grocery store. He pulls out his lunch from his backpack and takes a few bites of his sandwich before spotting the woman from the store walking towards him. She sees him sitting on the bench and hesitates for a moment before coming over. "Hello," she says quietly, sitting down next to him. "I wanted to thank you for your help back at the store. My name is Lily." Aleksy introduces himself and the two chat for a bit. Lily seems a bit more relaxed now, but Aleksy still wonders about the object she was holding earlier. Finally, he musters up the courage to ask her about it. "It's nothing, really," Lily says, fidgeting with the object in her hand. "Just a lucky charm that my grandmother gave me." Aleksy nods, understanding now. He thanks Lily for talking with him and bids her farewell. As he watches her walk away, he can't help but feel a bit more lucky himself.
