Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob is sitting at his desk in his office, working on some papers. He is wearing a suit and tie, and looks very professional. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise outside. He gets up to investigate, and sees that the noise is coming from the coffee shop downstairs. He goes downstairs to see what is going on, and finds that the shop is being robbed! The robbers see him and start to chase him, but he is able to escape and call the police.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob ran as fast as he could, the robbers hot on his heels. He could hear their angry footsteps pounding the pavement behind him. He had to lose them. He ducked into an alleyway and hid behind a dumpster. The robbers ran past, not seeing him. Bob breathed a sigh of relief. He waited a few minutes to make sure they were gone, then emerged from his hiding spot. His heart was racing. He shook his head to clear it and then started to walk back to his office. He would have to call the police from there. As he walked, he couldn't help but replay the scene in his head. He had never seen anything like that before. He wondered if the robbers had gotten away with anything. He would find out soon enough. For now, he just wanted to put the whole incident behind him.
