Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob is sitting in his coffee shop, enjoying a cup of coffee and watching the people go by. It's early in the morning, and the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon. The streets are busy with people getting ready for their day. Bob sees a woman walking by, carrying a basket of fruit. She smiles and waves at him, and he returns the gesture. Suddenly, Bob hears a loud noise. He turns around and sees a group of men running towards the coffee shop, shouting and brandishing weapons. Bob knows what's happening: they're here to loot and pillage the place. He quickly grabs his shotgun and takes cover behind the counter. The men burst into the shop, and Bob opens fire. He takes down two of them before they can even react. The rest of the men return fire, and Bob is forced to duck behind the counter for cover. He hears the sound of shattering glass as the men start to destroy the shop. Bob knows he can't hold them off forever. He grabs a Molotov cocktail from under the counter and lights it. Then he throws it at the group of men. He hears screams as the men are engulfed in flames. Bob knows he has to get out of here. He grabs his shotgun and runs out the back door. He hears the sound of the men looting and destroying the shop as he makes his escape.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob runs through the alleyways, trying to put as much distance between himself and the looters as possible. He can hear them behind him, smashing and looting the coffee shop. He knows he won't be able to outrun them forever. He needs a place to hide. He spots a manhole cover and quickly lifts it, climbs down into the sewers. He replaces the manhole cover just as the looters run by. Bob sighs in relief, leaning against the wall. He knows he's safe for now. But he knows he can't stay here forever. He has to find a way out. He starts to make his way through the sewers, looking for an exit. He hears the sound of rats scurrying around in the darkness and tries to ignore it. He's getting closer to the exit. He can see a sliver of light up ahead. He starts to run towards it. But before he can reach it, he hears the sound of someone climbing down the ladder. Bob knows he's caught. He grabs his shotgun and prepares for a fight.
