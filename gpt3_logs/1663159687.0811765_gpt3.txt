SCENE: Aleksy is a grocery store clerk who lives in a small bedroom. It is evening, and he is just getting home from work. He is tired and hopes to get some sleep. He enters his room and sees that his bed is unmade. He does not see his pillow or blanket. He wonders where they could be. He looks around the room and sees that his window is open. He walks over to the window and looks outside. He sees his pillow and blanket on the ground. He wonders how they got there. He looks up and sees that his window is on the second story. He does not see anyone in the street. He wonders how his pillow and blanket got on the ground. He decides to go to bed and will worry about it in the morning.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy climbs into bed, his mind racing with questions about how his pillow and blanket ended up on the ground outside his window. He tries to tell himself that it doesn't matter, that he's just tired and imagines things, but he can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. He stares at the ceiling, wide awake, for what feels like hours before finally dozing off. Suddenly, he hears a noise coming from outside his window. He sits up, heart racing, and peers out into the darkness. At first, he doesn't see anything, but then he notices a shadowy figure standing in the street below. The figure seems to be looking up at Aleksy's window, but it's hard to tell in the darkness. Aleksy's heart pounds in his chest as he watches the figure, not knowing what to do. After a few minutes, the figure finally moves, slowly walking away from Aleksy's building. Aleksy lets out a breath he didn't realize he was holding and falls back onto his bed, his mind racing with questions and possibilities.
