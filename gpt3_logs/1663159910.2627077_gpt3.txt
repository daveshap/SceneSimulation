SCENE: Gabbi is in her early twenties and has been living in Africa for several years. She is a babysitter for a family with two young children. Today, she is taking the kids to a nearby park to play. As they walk, Gabbi points out different animals and plants to the kids. They see monkeys swings from the trees and a group of gazelles grazing in the distance. The kids are excited and ask lots of questions. After a few hours of playing, the kids are tired and ready to go home. Gabbi takes them by the hand and leads them back to the house. Along the way, they spot a snake sunning itself on a rock. Gabbi carefully points it out to the kids, making sure they don't get too close. When they arrive home, the kids' parents are there to greet them. Gabbi hands the kids off to their parents and says goodbye. She has another job to go to, but she'll be back tomorrow to play with the kids again.
