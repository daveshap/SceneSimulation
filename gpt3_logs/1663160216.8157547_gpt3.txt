Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn finishes his workday and walks to his car. He's exhausted from a long day of manual labor and is looking forward to relaxing at his country cottage. As he drives down the dirt road leading to his home, he takes in the peaceful surroundings. He sees the sun setting behind the trees and the wildflowers blooming in the meadow. He can hear the birds chirping and the leaves rustling in the breeze. As he approaches his cottage, he sees his cat, Jasper, waiting for him on the porch. He unlocks the door and is greeted by the warm, inviting atmosphere of his home. He lights a fire in the fireplace and settles into his comfortable armchair with a book. His cat jumps into his lap and purrs contentedly as he reads. Outside, the stars come out and the moon rises, casting a eerie light on the peaceful country cottage. But inside, Mashawn is cozy and safe by the warm fire, surrounded by the things he loves.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn wakes up the next morning to the sound of birds chirping outside his window. He stretches and yawns, then gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen to make breakfast. He hums to himself as he prepares his usual breakfast of eggs and toast. He sits down at the table to eat, and as he does, he hears a strange noise outside. He gets up to investigate, and as he does, he hears the noise again, louder this time. It sounds like something is crashing through the bushes. He approached the window cautiously and looks outside. To his surprise, he sees a large deer in his garden, eating his flowers. He watches it for a moment, then goes outside to shoo it away. The deer startles and runs off into the woods. Mashawn goes back inside and finishes his breakfast.
