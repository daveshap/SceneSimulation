Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Bob is standing on a mountaintop in Europe, surrounded by jagged peaks and dense forests. The sun is setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and red. Bob is admiring the view, feeling thankful for the peace and quiet of this remote location. Suddenly, Bob hears a loud noise coming from the direction of the nearest peak. He looks up just in time to see a large boulder tumbling down the mountainside, headed straight for him. Bob tries to run, but the boulder is too fast. It slams into him, crushing him instantly. As Bob's life fades away, he hears the sound of laughter coming from the peak.
