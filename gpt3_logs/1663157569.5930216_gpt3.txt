SCENE: Wang had just pulled up to the cottage and was getting the delivery out of the truck when he heard a loud noise. It sounded like something had crashed into the house. He quickly dropped the delivery and ran to the front door to see what was going on. When he got to the door, he saw a large hole in the wall and a man standing in the middle of the room, holding a baseball bat. The man was wearing a mask and Wang couldn't see his face. The man swung the bat at Wang and Wang ducked out of the way. He ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife from the counter. The man followed him and swung the bat at him again. Wang dodged out of the way and stabbed the man in the leg with the knife. The man dropped the bat and grabbed his leg, screaming in pain. Wang ran to the front door and opened it, then ran outside and yelled for help.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang ran out of the front door and saw the delivery truck still parked in the driveway. He ran to the truck and got in, then quickly drove away. He could hear the man screaming for help from the cottage, but he didn't want to stick around to find out what was going on. He drove to the nearest police station and told them what had happened. The police sent a squad car to the cottage to investigate. When they got there, they found the man with the baseball bat. He was still wearing the mask and they couldn't see his face. The man was bleeding from the stab wound in his leg and he was taken to the hospital. The police are still investigating the incident and they haven't released any information about the man or what his motive was.
