Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Jenna walks down the busy sidewalk, her backpack straps cutting into her shoulders. The sun is beating down on her, and she can feel the sweat trickling down her back. She's on her way to meet her friends for lunch, and she can't wait to get out of the heat. As she approaches the restaurant, she sees her friends sitting at a table near the window. They wave her over, and she eagerly makes her way inside. She slides into the seat next to her best friend, Katie, and lets out a sigh of relief. "It's so hot out there," she says, fanning herself with her hand. "I know," Katie responds. "I can't wait for summer to be over." Jenna nods in agreement as she opens the menu. She knows she won't be able to eat much in this heat, but she's determined to at least try.
