Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Mashawn is hard at work, hammering away at some steel beams. The sun is setting, casting a beautiful orange hue over the sky. The Eiffel Tower looms large in the background, its lights just beginning to twinkle in the dusk. Mashawn is sweating, his muscles straining with the effort. He pauses for a moment to wipe the sweat from his brow, before going back to work. The sound of his hammer ringing out against the steel is drowned out by the sound of a car horn honking. Mashawn looks up to see a group of tourists getting out of a taxi, eager to take some photos under the tower. He shakes his head and goes back to work, as the tourists snap away. The sky turns dark, and the lights of the Eiffel Tower come to life. They twinkle and glow, lighting up the night sky. Mashawn puts down his hammer and admires the view for a moment, before packing up his things and heading home.
