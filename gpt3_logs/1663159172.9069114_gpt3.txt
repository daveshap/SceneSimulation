Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck slowly down a dusty road. He is sweating profusely, and the setting sun is making it difficult to see. He is surrounded by tall grass and scrubby bushes. Suddenly, he sees a movement in the grass to his left and he slams on the brakes. His heart is pounding as he tries to see what it is. A moment later, a gazelle leaps out from the grass and dart across the road in front of the truck. Wang exhales in relief and continues on his way.
