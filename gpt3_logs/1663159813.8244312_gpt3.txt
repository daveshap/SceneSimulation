Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The moon casts a eerie glow over the scene as Gabbi, a babysitter, watches over her sleeping charges. All is quiet save for the sound of Gabbi's restless breathing. She can't help but feel on edge in this lonely place. Every so often, Gabbi's eyes drift towards the window. Outside, the craters and rocks of the moon's surface are lit up by the Earth's distant blue glow. It's a beautiful sight, but it only serves to remind Gabbi of how far away she is from home. She's not sure how much longer she can take this. The pay is good, but the isolation is driving her crazy. She's beginning to feel like she's the only human left in the universe. At least the kids are cute. That's something, at least.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi's eyes slowly drift closed as she begins to doze off. She's only half-aware of the sounds of the children stirring in their beds. A soft snore escapes her lips as she slips into a light sleep. Suddenly, Gabbi's eyes snap open as she hears a loud bang outside. She bolts upright in bed, her heart racing. For a moment, she just sits there, frozen in fear. Then, mustering up all her courage, she slowly gets up and goes to the window. Peering out, her eyes widen in terror as she sees a giant meteoric crashing towards the moon's surface. She watches in horror as it collides with the ground, creating a huge explosion. Gabbi stumbles backwards as the ground trembles beneath her feet. She quickly gathers the children and presses them close to her, trying to shield them from the terror unfolding outside. They cling to her, whimpering in fear. Gabbi can feel her own tears spilling down her cheeks as she watches the end of the world unfold before her eyes. There's nothing she can do but wait and hope that somehow, they all survive this.
