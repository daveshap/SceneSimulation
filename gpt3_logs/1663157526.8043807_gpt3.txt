Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The forest is dark and Wang is driving through it, early in the morning. He is delivering supplies to a remote village. The road is narrow and winding, and the trees hang low over it, making it feel even darker. Wang is a bit nervous, as he has heard stories about the forest being full of dangerous animals. But so far he has seen nothing but birds and small animals. As he rounds a bend in the road, he sees something moving in the shadows. He slows down, heart racing, and shines his headlights on the spot. There, in the middle of the road, is a large snake. Wang has never seen a snake this big before. It must be at least 10 feet long! He is frozen in fear, not knowing what to do. The snake starts to move toward the car. Wang panics and hits the gas. The car careens off the road and into the trees. Wang is shaken up but not hurt. He gets out of the car to assess the damage. The front of the car is smashed and the tires are flat. Wang is surrounded by the dark forest and has no idea what to do. He is scared and alone.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang is in shock after crashing his car. He stands next to the vehicle, surveying the damage and trying to wrap his mind around what just happened. His heart is still racing and he can't seem to get his bearings. He looks around, half expecting to see the snake again, but there is nothing. Only the darkness of the forest, broken by the beams of his headlights. He feels a cold chill run down his spine. Wang knows he needs to assess the damage to his car and figure out a plan. But he is Cold and alone and scared. He doesn't want to leave the safety of his car, but he knows he has to. He takes a deep breath and forces himself to take a few steps away from the car. His legs feels like jelly, but he manages to make it to a nearby tree. He leans against the tree for support and takes a look at the car. It's not good. The front end is smashed in and the tires are flat. He has no idea how he's going to fix it. He looks around, trying to get his bearings. He knows he is far off the road, and there is no way he can walk back to the village. He is completely lost and has no idea what to do. Wang feels like he is going to faint. He slides down the tree and sits on the ground. He puts his head between his knees and takes deep breaths, trying to calm himself down. He knows he has to think of a plan, but his mind is blank. He sits there for a long time, until he finally falls into a fitful sleep.
