Bob loves to people watch, and he's especially fond of watching the sunset from his vantage point beneath the tower. As the sun begins to set, Bob notices a young couple walking hand in hand towards the tower. They look so in love, and Bob can't help but smile at the sight. He's reminded of his own love story, and how he and his wife used to visit the Eiffel Tower on their anniversary. Suddenly, the young couple stops in front of Bob's coffee shop. They stare at him for a moment, before the woman says, "Excuse me, do you speak English?" Bob nods and greets them warmly. They explain that they're on their honeymoon, and they've always wanted to visit Bob's coffee shop. They ask if they can take a photo with him, and Bob is more than happy to oblige. He poses with them for a few photos, and they thank him before continuing on their way. Bob watches them go, feeling happy and grateful that he can bring a little bit of happiness to people's lives.
