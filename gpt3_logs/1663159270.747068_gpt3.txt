SCENE: Bob is a coffee shop owner who often takes walks on the beach to clear his head. Tonight, he's out for a walk in the middle of the night, enjoying the peace and quiet. He's not expecting to see anyone else out at this time, but he's not surprised when he sees a figure in the distance. As he gets closer, he realizes that it's a woman, and she looks to be in distress. She's frantically looking around, as if she's lost something. Bob approaches her and asks if she's okay. The woman is clearly distraught. She tells Bob that she's lost her wedding ring. She and her husband had been taking a walk on the beach earlier and she took her ring off to wash her hands in the ocean. But when she went to put it back on, it was gone. Bob offers to help her look for it. They spend the next hour combing the area, but they don't find the ring. Bob tells her that he's sorry, but he doesn't think they'll be able to find it in the dark. The woman is visibly upset. She thanks Bob for his help, and then she turns and walks away. Bob watches her go, feeling helpless. He knows how much that ring meant to her and he wishes he could have found it.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob went home that night feeling defeated. He couldn't stop thinking about the woman and her lost wedding ring. He felt terrible that he couldn't find it for her. He decided to take another walk on the beach, in the hopes that he might find the ring. He searched for hours, but he still didn't find it. He was about to give up when he saw something shining in the sand. He bent down and picked it up. It was the woman's wedding ring. He was so excited that he had found it. He started running back to her house, hoping he would find her there. When he got there, he knocked on the door and the woman's husband answered. Bob told him that he had found the ring and he handed it to him. The husband was so grateful. He invited Bob in for a cup of coffee. Bob accepted and they sat down to chat. The husband told Bob that his wife had been devastated when she lost her ring. Bob said that he understood how she felt, because he would feel the same way if he lost his own wedding ring. The husband thanked Bob again for finding the ring and invited him to come by the coffee shop anytime. Bob said he would, and then he went home.
