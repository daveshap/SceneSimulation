Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: As the sun sets, Aleksy enters his small bedroom in the apartment he shares with several other people. He closes the door behind him and begins to undress, taking off his work clothes and hanging them up neatly. He changes into a pair of comfortable pajamas and climbs into bed, letting out a contented sigh. Aleksy has had a long day at work and is grateful to finally be able to relax. He closes his eyes and soon falls asleep, dreaming of better days to come.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy's alarm clock goes off, jolting him awake. He rubs his eyes groggily and sits up, reaching for the alarm to turn it off. He swings his legs over the edge of the bed and stands up, stretching his arms over his head. He yawns and makes his way to the small dresser in the corner of the room, where he selects a pair of clean clothes for the day. He dresses quickly and then heads for the door, pausing to take one last look at his room before leaving.
