Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It is mid-afternoon in a dark forest in South America. Mashawn, a construction worker, is walking through the forest, when he hears a noise in the bushes. He draws his knife and approaches cautiously. Suddenly, a group of men jump out from behind the bushes, yelling and brandishing clubs. Mashawn tries to run, but they quickly catch up to him and begin to beat him. He falls to the ground, unconscious. The men take his knife and wallet, and then disappear back into the forest.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn wakes up some time later, groggy and disoriented. He tries to get up, but his head is spinning and he feels like he's going to vomit. He tries to remember what happened, but the last thing he remembers is hearing a noise in the bushes. He looks around and sees that he's in a clearing in the middle of the forest. His knife and wallet are gone, and he has a pounding headache. He staggers to his feet and starts to make his way back to the construction site. He's lucky to be alive, but he'll be lucky if he makes it out of the forest in one piece.
