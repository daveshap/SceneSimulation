==========

Gabbi was in the middle of making lunch for the kids she was babysitting when she heard a loud noise coming from upstairs. She quickly finished making the sandwiches and ran upstairs to see what was going on. She found the two kids in the bathroom, with one of them trying to flush the other one down the toilet. Gabbi quickly pulled the child out of the toilet and scolded the other one for trying to flush her down the toilet. She then helped the child who was in the toilet to the bathroom and got them cleaned up. After that, she made sure that the bathroom was cleaned up and then went back to making lunch.
