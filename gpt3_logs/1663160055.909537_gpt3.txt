SCENE: Mashawn is busy at work, hammering away at some bolts on the underside of the Eiffel Tower. He's been working on this section for a few hours now, and he's starting to get hungry. He takes a quick break to eat his lunch, sitting on a girder with his feet dangling over the edge. He looks out at the view of Paris spread out below him and takes a deep breath of the fresh air. What a day to be working on the Eiffel Tower!

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn takes a quick break to eat his lunch, sitting on a girder with his feet dangling over the edge. He looks out at the view of Paris spread out below him and takes a deep breath of the fresh air. What a day to be working on the Eiffel Tower! He unwraps his sandwich and takes a bite, savoring the taste of the fresh bread and roasted turkey. He looks out at the cityscape and can't help but feel a sense of pride at his accomplishments. It's not every day that you get to say you've worked on one of the most famous landmarks in the world. He finishes his sandwich and climbs back down to finish his work. He'll be back up here tomorrow, but for now, it's time to head home and get some rest.
