SCENE: Tom had just gotten off work from his bartending job and was walking through the office building where he worked to head home for the night. It was the middle of the night and the building was mostly empty, but Tom still felt a bit on edge as he walked through the darkened halls. He kept thinking he heard someone following him, but every time he turned around there was no one there. Eventually he made it to the exit and breathed a sigh of relief as he stepped outside into the cool night air.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom quickened his pace as he exited the building, his mind still racing with the thoughts of someone following him. He hurried down the street, glancing over his shoulder every few seconds, but there was still no one there. He was just about to turn the corner when he heard footsteps behind him. This time, when he turned around, there was someone there. A tall, shadowy figure was standing just a few feet away from him, not moving or saying a word. Tom's heart raced as he slowly backed away, his mind frantically searching for a way to escape. He turned and ran in the opposite direction, but the figure seemed to glide effortlessly after him. Tom could hear its breathing, steadily getting closer and closer as it pursuit. Just as it was about to catch up to him, Tom felt something hard and cold touch the back of his neck and everything went black.
