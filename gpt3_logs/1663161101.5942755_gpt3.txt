SCENE: The sun has just begun to set, casting a warm glow over the countryside. Aleksy is sitting on the porch of his small cottage, enjoying the peace and quiet. He's been working long hours at the grocery store lately, and it's nice to finally have some time to relax. The air is thick with the scent of summer flowers, and Aleksy can hear the gentle tinkling of wind chimes in the distance. A bird suddenly appears on the porch railing, cocking its head to one side and regarding Aleksy with bright eyes. The two of them stare at each other for a moment before the bird takes off again, disappearing into the deepening twilight. Aleksy lets out a contented sigh and leans back in his chair, closing his eyes and enjoying the peaceful evening.

He remains on the porch for a while longer, taking in the beauty of the evening.
