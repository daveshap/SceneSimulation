Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The concert is in full swing, the music is pumping and the crowd is going wild. Wang is in the middle of the chaos, delivering food to the concession stands. He weaves his way through the crowd, dodging flying elbows and dancing feet. The noise is deafening, but Wang is used to it. He's been delivering food to this concert venue for years, and he knows the layout like the back of his hand. He makes his way to the concession stand, where the workers are busy keeping up with the demand. Wang hands over the food and gets a few thank-yous from the workers. He smiles and nods, then turns to go back out into the maelstrom. He has to shout to be heard over the music as he asks the workers how their night is going. The concert goes on late into the night, but Wang doesn't mind. He's happy to be doing what he loves - delivering food to people who are enjoying themselves. He knows that when the concert is over, he'll be able to get some rest. But for now, he's content to keep dancing and delivering.
