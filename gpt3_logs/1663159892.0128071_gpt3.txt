Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck up a narrow, winding mountain road. The sun is shining and the sky is blue, but the air is cool and Wang can see his breath in the truck's cab. As he nears the top of the mountain, Wang sees a beautiful castle perched atop a rocky outcropping. He slows the truck and stares at the imposing structure for a moment before continuing on. A few minutes later, Wang arrives at the castle gates and stops the truck. He climbs down and opens the gates, then drives the truck through. A moment later, he is standing in front of the castle, looking up at its towering facade. Wang feels a sudden sense of dread, but he shakes it off and approaches the castle door. He knocks and waits, but there is no answer. He knocks again, louder this time, but still there is no response. Wang begins to feel uneasy. He looks around, but there is no one in sight. He decides to leave and come back later. As he turns to go, he sees a movement in one of the castle windows. He freezes, heart pounding, but there is no further movement. Wang tells himself it was just his imagination and backs away from the castle slowly. He gets back in his truck and drives down the mountain, never once looking back.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang drives his delivery truck down the mountain, his heart pounding in his chest. He can't shake the feeling that something is watching him, but he doesn't dare look back. He concentrates on the road ahead, willing the truck to move faster. He doesn't relax until he reaches the bottom of the mountain and is back on level ground. He breathed a sigh of relief and wiped the sweat from his brow. It was then that he realized he had left the castle gates open. He cursed himself for being so careless and turned the truck around. He glanced up at the castle as he drove through the gates, half expecting to see something staring down at him, but he saw nothing. He shook off the feeling of unease and drove back down the mountain, never once looking back.
