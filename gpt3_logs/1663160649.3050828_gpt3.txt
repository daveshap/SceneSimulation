Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Tom is taking a break from work and is in his bedroom. He is sitting on his bed with a sandwich in hand. His TV is on and he is flipping through the channels. He stops on a news channel and starts to watch. After a few minutes, he gets up and turns off the TV. He goes to his dresser and takes out a envelope. He sits back on the bed and looks at the envelope.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom sits on his bed, looking at the envelope in his hands. He thinks about what it could contain - his mind races with possibilities. After a few minutes, he decides to open it. He carefully slides his finger under the seal and breaks it open. He pulls out a sheet of paper and reads it. His eyes widen in surprise as he realizes what it says. He crumples up the paper and throws it across the room, letting out a frustrated yell. He gets up and pace around the room, trying to calm himself down. After a few minutes, he sits back on the bed and looks at the envelope again. He takes a deep breath and slowly opens it, pulling out the paper once more. He reads it again, his face betraying no emotion. He calmly folds the paper back up and puts it back into the envelope. He stands up and goes to his dresser, retrieving a suitcase from the bottom drawer. He starts packing a few clothes and personal items into the suitcase, not taking his eyes off the envelope the whole time. Once he's finished, he grabs the envelope and the suitcase and leaves the room, not looking back.
