Gabbi finishes her last job of the day, babysitting for a family with two young kids. It's been a long day, and she's ready to go home and relax. She gathers her things and heads for the door, but before she can reach it, she hears a noise coming from the other side. It sounds like someone is trying to break in. Gabbi quickly grabs a nearby lamp and hides behind the door, heart racing. She waits for a few moments, but the noise doesn't stop. It sounds like the person is getting closer. Just as the person is about to reach the door, Gabbi swings the lamp at them, knocking them out cold. She then call the police and waits for them to arrive. When they do, they take the intruder away and thank Gabbi for her quick thinking. Gabbi is shaken up but relieved that the ordeal is over. She goes home and tells her family what happened, and they all agree that it was a good thing she had the presence of mind to grab the lamp and defend herself.
