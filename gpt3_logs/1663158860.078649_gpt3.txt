SCENE: It's 6pm and Mashawn is just getting home from a long day of work. He's exhausted, but he knows he needs to get started on his chores for the evening. First, he heads to the bedroom to change out of his work clothes. He strips down to his boxers and climbs into bed, letting out a deep sigh of relief. The sheets are cool and feel good against his skin. He close his eyes and allows himself to relax for a few minutes before he gets up to start on his chores.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn wakes up with a start, realizing he must have dozed off. He gets up quickly, feeling guilty for taking a nap when he still has so much to do. He hastily changes into some old clothes and heads downstairs to start on the dishes. The kitchen is a mess, with dirty dishes piled up in the sink. Mashawn sighs, knowing it's going to take him a while to clean up this mess. He gets to work, scrubbing the dishes and putting them away. Once the kitchen is clean, Mashawn moves on to the living room. He picks up the dirty clothes strewn about the room and puts them in the hamper. He dusts all the surfaces and straightens up the furniture. Finally, Mashawn heads upstairs to the bathroom to clean it. He scrubs the toilet and the sink, and mops the floor. By the time he's finished, he's exhausted. But he feels good knowing that the house is clean.
