Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun had just started to peek over the horizon, sending long fingers of light through the trees and over the delicate flowers that surrounded the cottage. Birds were just starting to chirp their morning songs as Aleksy stepped out of the door, a basket under his arm. He stopped for a moment to take in the peacefulness of the morning, and then started down the path towards the village. He had to be at the store early today, and he didn't want to be late. The walk into the village was pleasant, and Aleksy breathed in the fresh air deeply, enjoying the peace and quiet. The village was still asleep when he arrived at the store, but he knew that wouldn't last long. He unlocked the door and stepped inside, flipping on the lights. He started unpacking the basket of produce he had brought with him, and then he heard the door open. He turned to see who it was, and his heart sank when he saw who it was. It was Vlad, the village bully. Vlad was a large man, and he always liked to intimidate people.Aleksy was sure that Vlad was going to make his life difficult today.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Vlad sauntered into the store, looking around with an arrogance that made Aleksy want to shrink away. Vlad was always making people feel small, and Aleksy was no exception. Vlad padded over to where Aleksy was standing, and he smirked down at him. "You're up early this morning, Aleksy," Vlad said in a deep, booming voice. "What's in the basket?" Aleksy swallowed hard, his heart pounding in his chest. He didn't want to give Vlad any trouble, but he knew that Vlad would take whatever he wanted. "Just some produce from my farm," Aleksy said, trying to sound confident. Vlad reached into the basket and grabbed an apple, taking a big bite out of it. "Mmm, this is good," he said, smacking his lips. "I'll take this." Aleksy didn't say anything, and Vlad just laughed. "Don't worry, I'll pay you for it," Vlad said, reaching into his pocket and throwing a couple of coins on the ground. "That should cover it." Aleksy just stood there, feeling helpless. He knew there was nothing he could do to stop Vlad from taking whatever he wanted. All he could do was hope that Vlad would get bored and move on to someone else.
