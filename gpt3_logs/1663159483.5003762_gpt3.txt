Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sky is a deep black, punctured by a million stars. The horizon is a sharp line, dividing the inky sky from the equally dark surface of the moon. Wang is driving his delivery truck across the lunar landscape. He's been on the job for hours, and he's getting tired. He has a few more deliveries to make before he can call it a day. The truck lurches to a stop. Wang curses under his breath. He knows he should have gotten the truck serviced before undertaking this job. He's going to have to walk the rest of the way. He climbs out of the truck and starts walking. He's not sure how far he has to go, but he knows it's not far. He's been making these deliveries for weeks, and he's gotten to know the terrain well. The ground is uneven and rocky. Wang has to watch his step so he doesn't trip and fall. He's getting close to his destination. He can see the lights of the research station in the distance. He's almost there when he hears a noise. He stops and listens, but he can't quite place it. It sounds like something is moving around in the rocks. Wang starts to feel uneasy. He's about to turn back when he sees a pair of eyes shine in the darkness. Wang freezes. He's not sure what to do. The eyes move closer, and Wang can see that they belong to a large creature. The creature is definitely not human. Wang has no idea what it is. He's never seen anything like it before. The creature is moving closer and Wang is paralyzed with fear. He's about to turn and run when the creature speaks. "Hello," it says. "I'm not going to hurt you." Wang is so surprised that he doesn't know what to say. "I'm just here to deliver a message," the creature continues. "You need to leave this place. It's not safe here anymore." Wang is still in shock, but he manages to nod. "Okay," he says. "I'll go." The creature nods and then disappears back into the darkness. Wang doesn't know what to think. He's never seen anything like that before. He starts to walk back to the truck, but he can't shake the feeling that something is watching him.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang climbs back into his truck and starts to drive. He can't believe what just happened. He's never seen anything like that creature before. He's not sure what to make of its warning. He knows he should leave, but he's not sure he's ready to abandon the research station. He's been working there for weeks, and he's made some good friends. He's not sure he's ready to leave them behind. He decides to drive back to the station and warn his friends about the creature. He knows they won't believe him, but he has to try. He drives closer to the station and can see the lights in the distance. He's about to pull up to the station when he sees something moving in the shadows. He can't quite make it out, but it looks like the creature. He's not sure what to do. He doesn't want to confront it again, but he knows he has to. He takes a deep breath and drives towards the creature. It comes into the light and he can see that it's the same creature. It's standing in the middle of the road, blocking his way. Wang stops the truck and gets out. "Hello again," he says. "I'm just trying to warn my friends. They need to leave this place. It's not safe here." The creature looks at him and shakes its head. "They won't listen to you," it says. "You need to leave now. This place is going to be destroyed." Wang is about to say something, but he's interrupted by a loud explosion. He looks up and sees the research station blowing up. Wang is in shock. He can't believe what he's seeing. The creature was right. This place is no longer safe. He knows he needs to leave. He climbs back into his truck and drives away.
