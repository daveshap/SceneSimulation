Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is beating down on the crowd of people crammed together in the concert venue. Aleksy is standing near the back, trying to get a glimpse of the stage. He's sweating in the heat, and he can feel the sticky beer spilling down his arm from the plastic cup he's holding. The music is so loud that it's making his head throb, but he's enjoying watching the people around him dancing and singing along. Every now and then, someone bumps into him and he has to steady himself to keep from being knocked over. He's getting a little claustrophobic, but he doesn't want to leave before the concert is over.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

The sun is beating down on the crowd of people crammed together in the concert venue. Aleksy is standing near the back, trying to get a glimpse of the stage. He's sweating in the heat, and he can feel the sticky beer spilling down his arm from the plastic cup he's holding. The music is so loud that it's making his head throb, but he's enjoying watching the people around him dancing and singing along. Every now and then, someone bumps into him and he has to steady himself to keep from being knocked over. He's getting a little claustrophobic, but he doesn't want to leave before the concert is over. Suddenly, the crowd surges forward and Aleksy is thrust up against the security barrier. He tries to shuffle backward, but there's nowhere to go. He's surrounded by people, all of them pushing and shoving to get closer to the stage. Someone steps on his foot and he yelps in pain, but no one pays any attention. He's completely trapped, and he can feel the panic rising in his chest. He's just about to lose it when he feels a hand on his shoulder. He turns to see his friend Joel, who gives him a reassuring smiles. Joel wedges himself into the space next to Aleksy and puts an arm around his waist, anchoring him in place. Aleksy takes a deep breath and tries to relax. He knows he's not going to be able to enjoy the rest of the concert, but at least he's not alone.
