SCENE: Mashawn is at a concert in the early morning hours. He is surrounded by people who are drunk and disorderly. The music is loud and the atmosphere is wild. Mashawn is not having a good time. He is trying to make his way through the crowd, but people are bumping into him and spilling beer on him. He is getting angry and is about to leave when he sees a girl who is alone and seems to be lost. He goes over to her and asks if she is okay. She says she is lost and needs help. Mashawn takes her by the hand and leads her out of the crowd. He takes her to his car and drives her home.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn and the girl walk out of the concert venue hand-in-hand. The girl is visibly shaken and looks relieved to be out of the crowd. Mashawn leads her to his car and opens the door for her. She gets in and he fastens her seatbelt for her. He gets in the driver's seat and starts the car. He drives out of the parking lot and onto the road. The girl gives him directions to her house. Along the way, they make small talk. The girl tells Mashawn that her name is Sarah. Sarah thanks Mashawn for his help and tells him that she had a really bad feeling about being in that crowd by herself. They pull up to Sarah's house and she invites Mashawn in for a drink. He politely declines and says that he needs to get home. Sarah thanks him again and gets out of the car. Mashawn watches her go into her house and then drives away.
