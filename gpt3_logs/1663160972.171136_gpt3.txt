SCENE: Bob the coffee shop owner is on the moon, in the middle of the night. He's all alone, and he's got a big pot of coffee brewing. He's got a few chairs and a table set up, and he's just waiting for customers. He's been on the moon for a few weeks now, and business has been slow. He's starting to wonder if maybe he made a mistake in opening up shop here. But he's not ready to give up just yet. He's decided to stay open all night, in hopes that someone will come by. He's not sure who or what he's expecting, but he's hopeful nonetheless. He's got the coffee brewing and the chairs set out, and he's just waiting. He's not sure what the night will bring, but he's ready for it.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The night sky is dark and oppressive overhead, and the only light comes from Bob's coffee pot. It casts a small circle of light in the otherwise inky blackness. Bob sits at his table, nursing a cup of coffee and staring out into the darkness. He's been on the moon for weeks now, and business has been slow. He's starting to wonder if maybe he made a mistake in opening up shop here. But he's not ready to give up just yet. He's decided to stay open all night, in hopes that someone will come by. He's not sure who or what he's expecting, but he's hopeful nonetheless. He takes a sip of his coffee and looks around his small shop. He's got a few chairs and a table set up, and he's just waiting for customers. The night drags on and Bob starts to feel drowsy. His eyes start to droop and his head starts to nod. Just as he's about to fall asleep, he hears a noise outside. He sits up straight and listens intently. There it is again! Someone's definitely out there. He gets up and walks to the door, peering out into the darkness. He can't see anything, but he knows someone is there. He opens the door and steps outside, squinting into the darkness. "Hello?" he calls out. "Is someone there?" There's no answer, but he knows someone is there. He can feel it. He takes a few steps forward, and then he sees it. A figure, lurking in the shadows. Bob's heart starts to race and he takes a step back. The figure starts to move towards him, and Bob can see it's a person. A person wearing a space suit. Bob's heart relaxes a bit and he takes a step forward. "Hello?" he says again. "Can I help you?" The figure doesn't answer, but continues to move closer. Bob can see it's a woman now, and she's coming right towards him. She's got her visor down, and Bob can't see her face. She comes to a stop in front of him, and just stands there. Bob looks at her for a moment, and then he has an idea. He goes back into his shop and comes out with a cup of coffee. He offers it to her, and she takes it. She removes her visor, and Bob can see she's smiling. "Thank you," she says. "I needed that."
