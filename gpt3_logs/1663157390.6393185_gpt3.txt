Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob stands beneath the Eiffel Tower, surveying his coffee shop. It's been a busy day, and he's pleased with the steady stream of customers. He's especially glad to see so many tourists, as they always tend to spend a little extra. He's just about to head back inside when he notices a large group of people walking towards him. They're all carrying cameras and Maps, and he can tell they're lost. He smiles and waves them over. "Welcome to my shop!" he calls out. "Can I help you find something?" The tourists crowd around him, eagerly asking for directions and recommendations. Bob takes his time with each of them, making sure they know exactly where they're going. He knows that if he can help them have a great experience in Paris, they'll remember his coffee shop and come back. After a few minutes, the group starts to disperse. Bob watches them go, feeling proud of his little shop. He knows that he's made a difference in their trip, and that's what he loves about his job.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob watches the last of the tourists walk away before heading back into his coffee shop. He's glad he was able to help them out and hopes they'll remember his shop when they come back to Paris. He's looking forward to a busy day tomorrow, but for now, he's going to close up shop and head home. He's been working hard lately and could use a good night's sleep. Bob sets about closing up the shop, turning off the lights and setting the alarm. He's just about to lock the door when he notices a group of teenagers walking by. They look like they're up to no good and he doesn't want them loitering around his shop. He calls out to them, telling them to move along. They give him a dirty look but eventually wander off. Bob locks the door and heads home for the night.
