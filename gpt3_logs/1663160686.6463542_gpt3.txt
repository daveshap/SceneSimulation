Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a cold, clear night, and Bob is walking under the Eiffel Tower, enjoying the view. He's wearing a heavy coat and scarf, and he's clutching a cup of hot coffee to warm his hands. He's thinking about how he's going to decorate his coffee shop for Christmas, and he's looking forward to the holidays. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him, and he turns to see a group of people walking towards him. They're all carrying supplies and weapons, and they're wearing dark clothing. Bob realizes they're robbers, and he starts to run. The robbers see him, and they give chase. Bob is running as fast as he can, but he's not used to running and he's quickly getting tired. The robbers are gaining on him, and he knows he won't be able to outrun them. He looks around desperately for help, but there's no one around. He's about to give up when he hears a loud noise, and the ground starts shaking. The Eiffel Tower is coming down, and it's heading straight for the robbers. Bob watches in amazement as the robbers are crushed by the falling Tower. He's still alive, and he's safe.
