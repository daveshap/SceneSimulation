Mashawn is working on a construction site in the city. It's a hot day and he's sweating from the heat and the physical labor. He takes a break to wipe the sweat from his brow and take a drink of water. He looks up at the skyline and marvels at the tall buildings. He's never been to the city before and he's impressed by the sights. He climbs up onto the scaffolding to get a better view and is dazzled by all the lights and movement. He can see people walking and cars driving and the hustle and bustle of the city. He feels a sudden urge to explore and see more of this new place. He climbs down from the scaffolding and decides to take a walk around the block. He wanders down streets and alleyways, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. He feels alive and invigorated by this new environment.
