SCENE: The sun was beating down on Jenna as she walked along the beach. She was carrying a towel and a bag with her lunch in it. She found a spot to sit down and spread her towel out. She opened her bag and took out her sandwich and a can of soda. She popped the can open and took a sip. She leaned back against the towel and enjoyed the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna was starting to get hungry, so she reached into her bag and pulled out her sandwich. She unwrapped it and took a bite, savoring the taste of the fresh bread and turkey. As she ate, she watched the people around her. She saw a group of children building a sandcastle and a couple walking hand in hand. She smiled and took another bite of her sandwich.
