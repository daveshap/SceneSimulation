Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is a delivery driver for the lunar base. It is 6pm and his shift is almost over. He is about to deliver a package to the last address on his route. Wang arrives at the address, a small dome on the edge of the base. He knocked on the door and is greeted by a women. She takes the package and thanks him. Wang is about to leave when he notices something strange. There is a light coming from inside the dome that shouldn't be there. He decides to investigate. Wang enters the dome and immediately notices that the walls are covered in a strange pink goo. He also sees that the woman is slumped over in a chair, apparently unconscious. Wang rushes to the woman's side to see if she is okay. He finds that she is still alive, but barely. She is mumbling something about "the pink goo." Wang realizes that he needs to get help. He runs back to the base to get help.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang sprints back to the base, his heart pounding in his chest. He knows he needs to find help for the woman, but he's not sure where to go. He arrives at the main entrance to the base and is relieved to see two security guards standing outside. He rushes up to them, panting and sweating. "Help me," he says, "there's a woman in trouble. She's covered in some kind of pink goo and she's unconscious." The security guards exchange a look before one of them says, "Okay, we'll go check it out. You stay here." Wang watches as the security guards head off towards the woman's dome. He stands there for a few minutes, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, he hears a scream coming from the direction of the dome. Wang takes off running towards the sound. As he gets closer, he can see that the pink goo is now covering the entrance to the dome. There's no way the security guards are going to be able to get inside. Wang knows he has to do something. He takes a deep breath and charges towards the goo, plunging headfirst into it. He feels himself being pulled inside the dome and the next thing he knows, he's standing in the middle of a pink mist. He can hear the woman screaming for help, but she's nowhere to be seen. Wang starts to feel lightheaded and dizzy. He knows he needs to find the woman and get out of there before the goo destroys him too. He starts to walk forward, but it's difficult to see through the mist. Suddenly, he feels something slimy wrap around his leg, tripping him. He falls to the ground and feels the goo start to cover his body. He screams for help as he feels himself being pulled into the pink mist.
