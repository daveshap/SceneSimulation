Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Mashawn is driving down a dirt road leading to a small country cottage. The sun is shining and the birds are chirping as he approaches the cute little house. He parks his truck and gets out, admiring the beautiful flowers blooming around the front porch. He climbs the steps and knock on the door, waiting for a moment before it opens. A woman with graying hair and a kind face answers the door. She smiles at him and invites him in. He steps into the cozy living room and she leads him to a seat. She asks him what brings him there and he tells her he's looking for work. She says she's been needing someone to help her with some odd jobs around the property and he agrees to do it. She shows him what needs to be done and he goes to work. He starts by trimming the hedges around the perimeter of the property. He then mows the lawn and does some weeding in the flower beds. After a few hours of work, he's completed everything on her list. He packs up his tools and says goodbye to the woman, telling her he'll come back tomorrow to finish up.
