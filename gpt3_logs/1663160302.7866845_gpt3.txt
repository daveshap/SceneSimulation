Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi is a software engineer who is currently working on a project in Africa. It is the middle of the night, and she is sitting in her tent, working on her laptop. She is surrounded by the sounds of the African wilderness - the calls of the animals, the rustling of the leaves in the breeze. She is wearing a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She is concentrating on her work, typing away at her laptop. Every so often, she stops to check her phone, which is sitting on the table next to her.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi continues to work on her project, typing away at her laptop. She occasionally stops to check her phone, which is still sitting on the table next to her. She is starting to get tired, and her eyes are starting to droop. She rubs her eyes and takes a deep breath, trying to stay awake. She looks at her watch and sees that it is 3:00 a.m. She knows she needs to keep working, but she can't keep her eyes open. She tries to stand up and stretch her legs, but her body is too tired. She sits back down and tries to focus on her work, but her eyes keep drooping. She finally decides to give up and goes to lie down in her sleeping bag. She sets her alarm for 6:00 a.m. and falls asleep.
