Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. He is tired and wants to make his delivery so he can return to his hotel and rest. He is not familiar with the area and is having trouble seeing the road. Suddenly, he hears a noise in the forest and slows down to investigate. He sees a large animal standing in the road. He does not know what it is and is afraid it will attack him. He slams on the brakes and the truck skids to a stop. The animal is a jaguar and it is about to attack Wang.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The jaguar moves closer to the truck, its eyes glittering in the moonlight. Wang's heart is pounding in his chest and he knows he has to act fast. He reaches for the gun he keeps in the glove compartment and aims it at the jaguar. The animal is just about to leap onto the truck when Wang fires the gun. The bullet hits the jaguar in the head and it falls to the ground, dead. Wang is shaking, but he knows he has to keep going. He drives the truck the rest of the way to the village and makes his delivery. Then he finally returns to his hotel, where he can rest and try to forget the incident in the forest.
