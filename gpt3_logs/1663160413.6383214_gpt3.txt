SCENE: Bob is in his bedroom, sitting at his desk with his laptop open in front of him. He's munching on a sandwich as he reads something on the screen. Suddenly, his phone rings and he answers it. "Hey, what's up?" he says into the phone. He listens for a moment, then his face breaks into a smile. "That's great news! I'll be right there." He hangs up the phone and starts to get up from his desk, but his cat winds itself around his legs, meowing for attention. Bob stoops down to give the cat a quick pat, then hurries out of the room.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob steps out into the hallway, still smiling from the news he just received. He quickly makes his way to the living room, where his girlfriend is sitting on the couch. She smiles at him as he walks in and he gives her a quick kiss on the cheek. "So, what's the good news?" she asks, eager to hear what has put such a big smile on his face. "I got the job!" he replies, still unable to contain his excitement. "They want me to start next week." "That's amazing news, Bob! Congrats!" He sits down next to her on the couch and they chat for a bit about his new job and what it will entail. Bob is all smiles, clearly thrilled about this new opportunity. After a few minutes, he gets up to head to the kitchen to celebrate with a quick drink.
