SCENE: It's a beautiful day and Swathi is enjoying a hike on a mountaintop in Europe. She's taken in the stunning views and is now resting on a large boulder, enjoying a snack and soaking up the sunshine. Suddenly, she hears a loud noise and looks up to see a massive avalanche coming right towards her. She has just enough time to jump off the boulder and take cover behind a tree before the avalanche hits. Swathi is terrified as she watches the snow and debris come thundering down around her. She's relieved when it finally stops and she's able to assess the damage. Thankfully, she's unharmed but her heart is pounding from the near-miss.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi's heart is racing as she tries to process what just happened. She can't believe she survived; it was truly a miraculous escape. She looks around at the aftermath of the avalanche and sees that her backpack is buried under a pile of snow. She starts to dig it out, her hands shaking from the adrenaline rush. Once she has her backpack, she takes a moment to catch her breath and calm her nerves. She knows she needs to get off the mountain as quickly as possible in case another avalanche happens. Sheraphics her bearings and starts to make her way down the mountain, being careful of any loose snow or debris. She's grateful to be alive and even more grateful to have made it off the mountain safely.
