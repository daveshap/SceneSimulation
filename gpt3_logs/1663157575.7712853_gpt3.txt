SCENE: The waves lap quietly against the shore, the sound a gentle back and forth inviting Swathi to come closer. The water is cool and refreshing, and she savors the sensation of the cool liquid flowing over her feet and ankles. She walks slowly, relishing the feel of the sand between her toes, the way the Earth seems to yield to her with each step. The sun is setting, and the sky is ablaze with colors. Swathi feels a sense of peace settle over her as she watches the sun dip below the horizon. She takes a deep breath of the salty air and lets out a contented sigh. This is her favorite time of day, when the world seems to be at peace and she can just be alone with her thoughts. She lets her mind wander as she walks, thinking about her life and all that she's accomplished. She's grateful for her happy life, but she can't help but feel a little bit lonely sometimes. Eventually, she comes to a stop and sits down in the sand, letting the waves wash over her feet. She gazes out at the water, her mind calm and at ease. This is her happy place, where she can just be herself and feel at peace with the world.
