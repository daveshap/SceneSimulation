Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The alarm clock goes off, jolting Mashawn out of a deep sleep. He reaches over and smacks the snooze button before rolling out of bed. His feet hit the cold floor and he shivers as he makes his way to the bathroom. He stares at himself in the mirror and lets out a long sigh before starting the shower. The hot water feels good as he stands there, letting the sleep slowly drain out of his body. He thinks about the day ahead as he scrubs himself clean. Another day on the construction site. He's been working there for months, and he's starting to get pretty fed up with it. But he needs the money, so he'll just have to suck it up and keep going. He steps out of the shower and dries off before getting dressed. He gives himself one last look in the mirror before heading out the door. He knows it's going to be a long day.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn steps out of the shower and is hit with a blast of cold air. He shivers as he reaches for a towel to dry off. He looks in the mirror and sees the tired look in his eyes. He knows he needs to get moving if he wants to make it to work on time. He quickly gets dressed and heads for the door. He's about to leave when he remembers he needs to grab something to eat. He opens the refrigerator and looks inside, but there's nothing that looks good to him. He doesn't have time to cook anything, so he'll just have to settle for a sandwich from the gas station. He grabs his keys and wallet and heads out the door.
