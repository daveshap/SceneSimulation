He cleans up his tools and equipment, and then heads to the subway station. The city is alive with energy at night. The streets are bustling with people, and the lights are bright. Mashawn feels a sense of excitement as he walks through the city. He takes the subway home, and when he gets off at his stop, he's ready to relax and enjoy the rest of his evening.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn walks into his apartment and is greeted by his dog, Max. He gives Max a pat on the head and then heads to the kitchen to make himself a drink. He opens the fridge and grabs a beer, then heads to the living room to relax on the couch. He turns on the TV and starts flipping through the channels, looking for something to watch. After a few minutes, he settles on a movie and starts to relax. He doesn't notice the time passing as he watches the movie, and soon it's time for bed. He gets up and stretches, then heads to his bedroom and gets ready for bed.
