Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Bob steps into his bedroom, yawning and rubbing his tired eyes. He kicks off his shoes and flopping down onto the bed, stretches his arms above his head with a satisfied sigh. The room is fairly small, but cozy with dark green walls and soft lighting. There is a dresser against one wall and a small nightstand by the bed, both cluttered with Bob's things. The bed itself is unmade, the covers thrown back in haste this morning. As Bob lays there, he lets his mind wander back over the events of the day. He remembers the early rush of customers at the coffee shop, the never-ending stream of orders, and the delighted smiles of the customers when they received their drinks. He also remembers the Employee of the Month award he received at the staff meeting this afternoon. Bob smiles to himself, feeling happy and content. It's been a good day, he thinks to himself, and tomorrow is bound to be even better. With that final thought, Bob drift off to sleep, dreaming of the exciting adventures that await him in the coming days.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob wakes up slowly, the light filtering in through the window gradually getting brighter and brighter. He blinks a few times, letting his eyes adjust, and then sits up, stretch his arms above his head with a yawn. He gets out of bed, feeling refreshed and well-rested after his nap, and goes over to the mirror to take a look at himself. His hair is a little messy, but he doesn't mind. He gives himself a quick once-over, making sure he looks presentable, and then heads out of the room. As he walks down the hall, he can hear the sounds of his roommates moving around in the kitchen. He follows the noise, and sure enough, finds them both there, making breakfast. His stomach grumbles, and he realizes he's starving. He hadn't eaten anything since lunch yesterday. "Hey guys," he greets them, walking over to the fridge to see what they have. "What's for breakfast?"
