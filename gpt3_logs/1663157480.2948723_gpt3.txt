SCENE: Tom is standing on the beach, looking out at the ocean. It's a beautiful day, and the water is calm and peaceful. He's surrounded by palm trees and the sand is warm and soft. He's wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, and he has a towel around his neck. He's holding a cocktail in one hand. He's been working at the bar all day, and he's ready to relax and enjoy the rest of his afternoon. He takes a sip of his drink and then leans back against a palm tree, closing his eyes and letting the sun wash over him.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom feels the warmth of the sun on his face and the softness of the sand below him. He takes a sip of his cocktail and savors the flavor of the rum. He feels relaxed and happy. He opens his eyes and looks out at the ocean. He sees the waves crashing against the shore and the birds flying overhead. He hears the sound of the waves and the sound of the birds. He smells the salt in the air and the fragrance of the flowers. He feels the breez blowing through his hair.
