Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's the middle of the night, and Aleksy is working the graveyard shift at the local grocery store. The store is brightly lit, and Aleksy is stocking shelves and cleaning up. He's been working for a few hours, and he's starting to feel pretty tired. Suddenly, the store's alarm system goes off. Aleksy knows that this means that someone has broken into the store. He quickly grabs a broom and starts trying to defend himself. The intruder is a big, burly man, and he quickly overpowers Aleksy. He ties him up and starts ransacking the store. Aleksy is terrified, and he thinks that the man is going to kill him. The man doesn't kill Aleksy, but he does rough him up pretty badly. He leaves him tied up in a corner of the store and makes off with a bunch of merchandise. Aleksy is relieved to be alive but traumatized by the experience.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy is still shaking from the ordeal as he tries to loosen the ropes binding him. His hands are numb and his fingers feel swollen, making it difficult to move. He looks around the store, trying to see if the intruder is still around. He doesn't see anyone, so he starts yelling for help. His voice is hoarse and his throat feels scratchy. He keeps yelling until he hears footsteps running towards the store. The police quickly enter the store and untie Aleksy. He tells them what happened, and they start scouring the store for evidence. Aleksy is asked to go down to the station and give a formal statement. He's still in shock, but he manages to answer the police officer's questions. He's released a few hours later, and he goes home to try and get some sleep.
