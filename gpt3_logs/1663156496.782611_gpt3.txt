Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna walks through the park, admiring the view of the Eiffel Tower. She's never been to Paris before and is in awe of the city around her. She notices a guy sitting on a bench, and she can't help but stare at him. He's tall, with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. She feels a sudden urge to talk to him, and she nervously approaches the bench. "Hi, um, do you speak English?" she asks, blushing slightly. He grins and nods, and they start talking. They discover that they have a lot in common, and they end up sitting on the bench for hours, talking and laughing. As the sun sets, he takes her hand and they walk to the top of the Eiffel Tower, where they watch the city lights come alive. Jenna knows that she's going to remember this night for the rest of her life.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun has set by the time Jenna and the guy finish talking on the bench, and he takes her hand as they walk to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The city lights come alive as they watch from above, and Jenna knows she'll remember this night for the rest of her life. The guy looks into her eyes and leans in for a kiss, and she eagerly responds. They spend the night walking around Paris, hand in hand, stopping to kiss every now and then. As the sun starts to come up, they find a spot on the banks of the Seine and watch the sunrise together. They're both exhausted by this point, but they're also both on a high from the night they just shared. They agree to meet up again the following night and say goodbye with a long kiss. Jenna walks away with a spring in her step, feeling like she's just experienced the best night of her life.
