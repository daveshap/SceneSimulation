Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Aleksy was in his bedroom in the middle of the night. He was awake, but he was not moving. He was just lying in his bed, staring at the ceiling. He was thinking about his life and how things were going. He was not happy with how things were going. He felt like he was stuck in a rut. He was working a dead-end job at a grocery store and he didn't have any prospects for the future. He was in his early twenties and he felt like he had wasted his life so far. He was unsure of what to do next, but he knew that he needed to make a change.
