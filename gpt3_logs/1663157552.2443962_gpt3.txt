SCENE: Aleksy leaned back against the crates of oranges, taking a long drag on his cigarette. He exhaled a stream of smoke, watching idly as it drifted up towards the rafters of the grocery store. It was quiet inside, the only sound the soft rustle of the wind outside and the occasional car passing on the street. Aleksy was supposed to be stocking the shelves, but he doubted anyone would come in for at least another hour. Let them have their lunch, he thought. I'll work when they're ready to buy. He flicked the cigarette butt away and pushed himself upright, stretching his arms over his head. He heard a soft moan from the other side of the store and his eyes widened. He wasn't alone after all. Aleksy cautiously made his way around the shelves, following the sound. He found a woman lying on the floor, her skin pale and clammy. She was moaning softly and Aleksy could see that she was clutching her stomach. He knelt down beside her, asking in broken English if she was alright. The woman shook her head, her face contorting in pain. Aleksy could see that she was in labor. He didn't know what to do, but he knew he had to help. He pulled out his phone and called for an ambulance, then did his best to comfort the woman until help arrived.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Aleksy stayed with the woman until the ambulance arrived, doing his best to keep her calm and comfortable. He rode in the back with her to the hospital, holding her hand and coaching her through each contraction. When they arrived at the hospital, Aleksy helped the paramedics wheel her into the delivery room. He waited outside, pacing back and forth anxiously. After what felt like hours, a doctor finally came out to see him. Aleksy's heart sank when he saw the doctor's somber expression. The woman had lost too much blood and there was nothing they could do. Aleksy was devastated. He had tried to help, but in the end, he was powerless. He turned and walked away from the hospital, his head hanging low.
