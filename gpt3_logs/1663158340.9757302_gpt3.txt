Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's mid-afternoon, and the sun is shining down on the peaceful country cottage. Bob, the coffee shop owner, is sitting on the porch, enjoying the quiet. He's surrounded by a beautiful garden, and he can hear the birds chirping in the trees. Suddenly, he hears a car pull up to the cottage. He gets up to see who it is, and he sees his old friend, John. John is a business owner, and he's come to Bob for advice. They sit down on the porch, and John tells Bob about his problem. He's been having a lot of trouble with his employees, and he doesn't know what to do. Bob listens carefully and offers his advice. After a few minutes, John thanks Bob and gets back in his car. Bob watched him drive away, and then he went back to his book.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

John drives away from the cottage, and he's deep in thought. He's trying to decide what to do about his employees. He knows that he needs to do something, but he's not sure what. He decides to go to the only person who can help him. He drives to the city and parks in front of a tall building. He walks into the building and takes the elevator to the top floor. He walks into an office, and a woman is sitting behind a desk. The woman is John's therapist, and she's been helping him with his problems for years. John sits down in the chair, and he starts to cry. He tells the therapist about his employees and how they're making his life difficult. The therapist listens carefully and offers her advice. John thanks her and leaves the office. He feels a little better, but he's still not sure what to do.
