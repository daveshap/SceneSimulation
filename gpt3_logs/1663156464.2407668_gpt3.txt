SCENE: It's mid-afternoon, and Wang is taking a break from his deliveries to enjoy a cup of tea in the peaceful country cottage he calls home. He's been driving for hours, and the break is welcomed. The cottage is nestled in a clearing among tall trees, and a stream flows nearby. The air is fresh and clean, and the sun is shining. Wang takes a deep breath and relaxes into his chair, savoring the quiet peace of his surroundings. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap. Startled, he looks around, but there's no one there. He grabs his walking stick and stands up, ready to defend himself if necessary. But the only thing he sees is a deer, standing calmly in the clearing and looking at him. Wang relaxes and laughs to himself. Then he goes back to his chair and enjoys the rest of his break in the quiet countryside.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang finishes his tea and stands up, stretching his legs. He walks over to the stream and looks down at the clear water flowing by. He can see fish swimming in the depths and he smiles. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap again. This time, he's sure it's not a deer. He grabs his walking stick and turns around, prepared to defend himself. But there's no one there. He looks around carefully, but there's no sign of anyone. He relaxes and laughs to himself again. Maybe it's just the wind, he thinks. But he decides to be more careful and goes back inside his cottage.
