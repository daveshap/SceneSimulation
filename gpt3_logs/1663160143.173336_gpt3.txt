Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It is early morning on the moon. Gabbi, a babysitter, is taking care of a young girl. They are both wearing lunar suits and helmets. They are in a lunar rover, driving across the lunar surface. Gabbi is pointing out various features of the landscape to the girl. They are both excited to be on the moon.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi and the girl continue to drive across the lunar surface, pointing out various features of the landscape. They spot a large crater in the distance and make their way towards it. As they approach, they can see that the crater is much larger than they thought. It is so big that they can't see the other side. They spend some time exploring the crater and then make their way back to the rover.
