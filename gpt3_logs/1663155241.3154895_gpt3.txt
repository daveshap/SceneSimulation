Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

Bob hops out of bed and stretches, taking a deep breath of the cold morning air. He slides his feet into his slippers, and heads downstairs to start a pot of coffee. He puts on a cozy sweater and starts a fire in the fireplace. The dog follows him around, wagging her tail. He puts a pan of water on the stove to boil some eggs, and sets the table. The sun starts to peek over the horizon, and the birds start chirping. The coffee is ready, and Bob sits down to enjoy a quiet breakfast by the fire.
