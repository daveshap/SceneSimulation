Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to set as Wang arrives at the country cottage. He pulls to a stop in front of the house and shuts off the engine. For a moment, he just sits there, taking in the peaceful surroundings. The cottage is nestled among a group of trees, and the front porch is lined with flowerpots. There is a small path leading up to the front door. Wang gets out of the car and grabs the package from the back seat. He walks up to the door and knocks. After a moment, the door is opened by a woman in her mid-40s. She has a kind face and is wearing a flowered apron. "Hi, I have a delivery for you," Wang says, handing her the package. "Thank you," she says, taking it from him. "Have a nice evening," Wang says, turning to walk back to his car. "You too," she says, closing the door.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang climbs back into his car and drives down the winding country road. The sun is now setting behind the trees, casting a golden glow over everything. Wang turns on the radio and hums along to the song playing. He approaches a fork in the road and takes the left path. After a few minutes, he arrives at a small lake. He pulls over to the side of the road and gets out of the car. He walks over to the edge of the lake and looks out at the water. The surface is calm and smooth, like a sheet of glass. Wang takes a deep breath of the cool, fresh air and feels his muscles start to relax. He sits down on the grass and watches as the sun continues to set. The sky turns from orange to purple, and the stars begin to come out. Wang looks up at the stars and wonders what it would be like to live in a place like this. He eventually falls asleep and doesn't wake up until the sun is rising the next morning.
