Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to peek over the mountaintops, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. A chill wind is blowing, and Tom is huddled up in his coat, shivering. He's been up here all night, waiting for the perfect moment to take a photograph. The mountaintop is covered in a light dusting of snow, and Tom's breath forms little clouds in the air. His fingers are numb from the cold, but he's determined to get the shot he came for. Suddenly, the sun pops up over the horizon, and Tom snaps the picture. He can't believe he got it! The view is absolutely stunning, and he knows this photo is going to be a winner.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Tom quickly stuffs the camera back in its case and begins the long trek down the mountain. His fingers are still numb from the cold, and he can't feel his toes. He's grateful for the extra pair of socks he put on this morning. The sun is high in the sky now, and the mountaintops are shining brightly. Tom stops to take a few more pictures on the way down. He knows he won't be able to capture the beauty of this place with just a few photos, but he's determined to try. It's going to be a long hike down, but Tom knows it will be worth it.
