Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Jenna is sitting in her office chair, staring at her computer screen with a look of concentration. She is typing away at the keyboard, her fingers moving nimbly over the keys. Every few moments, she pauses to think, biting her lip in concentration. She has been working on this project for hours, and she is determined to get it right. The office is quiet, save for the sound of Jenna's typing. The only light comes from the computer screen, casting a ghostly glow over Jenna's face. The rest of the room is shrouded in darkness. Jenna's eyes are beginning to sting from staring at the screen for so long, but she doesn't want to take a break. She knows she is getting close to finishing the project, and she doesn't want to lose her momentum. Suddenly, Jenna's concentration is broken by a noise from outside the office. She hears footsteps in the hallway, and then a voice calling her name. Jenna's heart sinks. She knows she should have locked the door. She tries to think of a way to stall for time, but before she can say anything, the person outside the office opens the door and walks in.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The person who enters the room is Jenna's boss. He is a tall, heavyset man with a balding head and a stern expression. He is carrying a stack of papers in one hand and a coffee mug in the other. Jenna's heart sinks as she realizes she is going to be in for a long meeting. Her boss starts to speak, but Jenna cuts him off. She knows she needs to buy herself some time. She tells him that she is almost finished with the project and just needs a few more minutes. Her boss looks skeptical, but Jenna is adamant. She pleads with him to give her just five more minutes, and her boss finally relents. He tells her that he will be back in five minutes, and then he leaves the office, closing the door behind him. Jenna lets out a sigh of relief and returns to her work. She knows she doesn't have much time, but she is determined to finish the project before her boss returns.
