Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck through the city streets. It is the middle of the night, but the city is still brightly lit. Wang is thinking about his family back home in China. He misses them dearly, but he knows that he must continue working to support them. As he drives, he notices a woman walking along the side of the road. She looks tired and dirty, as if she has been walking for a long time. Wang slows down and asks the woman if she needs help. The woman says that she is looking for a place to stay for the night. Wang tells her that she can stay in his truck. The woman is grateful and climbs into the passenger seat. Wang drives the woman to a nearby hotel and helps her get a room for the night. The woman thanks Wang and tells him that he is a good man. Wang simply nods and drives away.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Wang drives away from the hotel, his mind heavy with the woman's story. He can't help but feel guilty that he was able to drive away and leave her there, while she was homeless and alone. Wang decides to drive around the city for a while, to clear his head. As he drives, he notices a group of people standing on the side of the road. They look like they are about to start a protest or something. Wang slows down to take a closer look. Suddenly, the group of people start throwing rocks and bricks at his truck! Wang ducks down in his seat to avoid being hit, and quickly drives away. He can hear the sound of the rocks hitting his truck as he drives away. Wang is shaken by the incident, but he continues driving. He knows that he must be careful from now on.
