Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. A light breeze rustles the leaves of the trees surrounding the small country cottage. Birds are singing in the distance. All is peaceful and calm. Inside the cottage, Jenna is just waking up. She stretches and yawns, then climbs out of bed and heads to the window. She smiles as she looks out at the beautiful morning. Everything is so perfect and peaceful. Suddenly, Jenna hears a loud crash from the other room. She froze, her heart racing. What is that? She slowly creeps to the door and peeks around the corner. She sees a large, furry creature rummaging through her backpack, which is lying on the floor. Jenna gasps. It's a bear! The bear looks up and sees Jenna. For a moment, they just stare at each other. Then, Jenna turns and sprints out the door. She doesn't look back until she's safe.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Jenna is running as fast as she can, her heart pounding in her chest. She can hear the bear crashing through the woods behind her, but she doesn't dare look back. She knows she has to make it to the road. If she can just make it to the road, someone will see her and help her. She's almost there. She can see the road up ahead. She's almost to safety. And then she feels a sharp pain in her leg. The bear has caught up to her. She screams as the bear drags her into the woods. She tries to fight, but it's no use. The bear is too strong. She feels her body being ripped apart as the bear starts to eat her. There's nothing she can do. She's going to die.
