Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's lunch time on the moon, and Swathi is enjoying a meal in the airy, spacious cafeteria. The room is filled with light from the giant windows, and the colorful tables and chairs add a touch of levity to the otherwise sterile environment. Swathi is chatting with her fellow software engineers, joking and laughing about the latest code they're working on. The group is enjoying their break from the grind, but they all know they have to get back to work soon.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi and her co-workers finish their lunch and start to head back to their office. Swathi is in a good mood, joking and laughing with her co-workers as they walk. However, when they get to their office, they see that their boss is waiting for them. He doesn't look happy. Swathi and her co-workers exchange worried looks as they walk into the office and take their seats. The boss starts to speak. "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but we're going to have to let some of you go." There is a stunned silence in the room. Swathi can't believe it. She's been with the company for years and has always been a top performer. The boss continues, "We're just not making enough money to keep all of you on. I'm sorry." Swathi and her co-workers are horrified. They all start to speak at once, but the boss cuts them off. "I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. You'll all be given two weeks' severance pay. I'm sorry." Swathi and her co-workers are stunned. They gather their things and leave the office, their futures uncertain.
