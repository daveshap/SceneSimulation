==========

Mashawn is in the office building, getting ready to start his day. He's putting on his hard hat and getting his tools ready. He's got his hammer and his screwdriver, and he's all set to go. He's just about to walk out the door when he hears a voice behind him. "Mashawn, can I talk to you for a minute?" Mashawn turns around and sees his boss, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson looks worried, and he's wringing his hands. "What's up, Mr. Johnson?" Mashawn asks. "I'm sorry, Mashawn, but we're going to have to let you go," Mr. Johnson says. "We're just not going to need you anymore." Mashawn is stunned. He can't believe what he's hearing. He's been working for this company for years, and now he's being let go. "I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson, but I don't understand," Mashawn says. "What am I supposed to do now?" "I'm sorry, Mashawn, but there's nothing I can do," Mr. Johnson says. "You'll just have to find another job." Mashawn is heartbroken. He can't believe he's lost his job. He doesn't know what he's going to do now.
