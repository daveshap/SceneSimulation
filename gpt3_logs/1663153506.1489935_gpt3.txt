Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

It was getting dark, and Bob knew he had to find someplace to camp for the night. He had been walking through the forest for hours, and he was getting tired. He saw a light up ahead, and he walked towards it. When he got closer, he saw that it was a campfire. There were people around the fire, and they were speaking a language that Bob didn't understand. He didn't want to intrude, so he started to walk away. One of the people saw him and called out to him in English. Bob walked over to the fire and introduced himself. The people were friendly, and they offered him some food and a place to sleep for the night. Bob was grateful, and he accepted their offer. He sat down by the fire and ate the food they gave him. Then he lay down and went to sleep.
