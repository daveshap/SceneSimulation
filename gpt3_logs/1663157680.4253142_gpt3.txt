SCENE: Mashawn is viciously attacked by a lion while he is working on a construction site in Africa. The lion mauls him, tearing his flesh and leaving him severely injured. Mashawn screams for help, but no one is around to hear him. He eventually dies from his injuries.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Mashawn's screams echo through the deserted construction site. His body is wracked with pain as the lion continues to savage him. Blood pools around him, staining the dirt and sand a dark red. He tries to fight back, but the lion is too strong. Soon, Mashawn's strength starts to fail and his screams turn to weak whimpers. The lion keeps attacking, until Mashawn is nothing more than a bloody pulp. His lifeless body is left to be devoured by the scavengers of the African plains.
