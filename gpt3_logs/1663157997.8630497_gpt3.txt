Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Gabbi is in her charge's bedroom, straightening up some of the toys that are strewn about. She is humming to herself as she works when she suddenly hears a small noise from the closet. She freezes, listening carefully, but hears nothing else. After a moment's hesitation, she decides to investigate. She crosses the room to the closet and slowly opens the door. Peeking inside, she doesn't see anything at first. But then she notices a small form huddled in the corner, trying to make itself as small as possible. It's a little girl, who must have been hiding in the closet the whole time. Gabbi kneels down so she's at the child's level and asks her what she's doing in there. The girl just looks at her with big, scared eyes and doesn't say a word. Gabbi tries to reassure her that she's not in trouble, but the child still doesn't speak. Finally, Gabbi picks her up and carries her out of the closet. She sits down on the bed with the girl in her lap and strokes her hair soothingly. After a few minutes, the child begins to relax and falls asleep.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Gabbi continues to stroke the child's hair as she sleeps, feeling a pang of sadness at the thought of her own daughter who died a few years ago. She remembers the day she found out she was pregnant, and the joy she felt at becoming a mother. She also remembers the day her daughter was born, and how perfect and small she was. Gabbi tries not to think about the day her daughter died, but she can't help it. She remembers holding her close as she took her last breath, and the all-consuming grief that followed. Gabbi feels a tear run down her cheek, but she quickly wipes it away. She doesn't want the child to see her crying. After a few minutes, Gabbi gently lays the child down on the bed and covers her with a blanket. She then quietly leaves the room, closing the door behind her.
