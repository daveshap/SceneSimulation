Detailed description of the scene and events:

==========

The sun beats down mercilessly on the parched landscape. Swathi, a software engineer, is on a research trip in Africa. She is sweating profusely, and her clothing is sticking to her skin. She is surrounded by dense jungle, and the only sound is the cicadas chirping in the trees. Suddenly, she hears a loud rustling in the bushes. She freezes, unsure of what to do. A large snake slithers out from the undergrowth and begins to coil itself around her. She is paralyzed with fear. The snake hisses menacingly and strikes at her with its fangs. She feels a sharp pain in her leg as the venom seeps into her bloodstream. She knows she is in trouble. She tries to scream for help, but the venom is already starting to affect her vocal cords. She feels lightheaded and dizzy. She knows she needs to get help fast, but she doesn't know where to turn.
