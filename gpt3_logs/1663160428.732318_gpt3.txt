Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Gabbi is walking through the forest, holding a torch in one hand and a baby in the other. She is careful to watch her step, as the ground is uneven and there are roots and rocks protruding from the earth. She has been walking for some time, and she is now quite tired. The baby is getting heavy, and her arm is starting to throb from the effort of carrying it. She turns a corner, and the forest opens up into a small clearing. In the center of the clearing is a small, dilapidated cabin. Gabbi approaches the cabin cautiously, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows that this is where the witch lives. She knocks on the door of the cabin, and a few moments later, an old woman answers. The woman is hunched over and has a long, hooked nose. She is wearing a tattered black dress and a black shawl. "Who are you?" the woman hisses. "I'm Gabbi," the babysitter responds. "I'm here to drop off the baby." The witch takes the baby from Gabbi's arms and cackles wickedly. "Thank you, my dear. You have served me well." Gabbi turns and runs back the way she came, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows that she has just delivered a baby to a monster, and she will never forget the look on the witch's face.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The witch cackles wickedly as she takes the baby from Gabbi's arms. "Thank you, my dear. You have served me well." The baby starts to cry, and the witch jiggles it roughly in an attempt to quiet it. When that doesn't work, she sets the baby down on the floor and rummages through a drawer for a moment before pulling out a long, sharp knife. The baby crying turns to screams, and Gabbi covers her ears, trying to block out the sound. She knows she should run, but she can't make her legs move. She's frozen in place, terror coursing through her veins. The screams stop suddenly, and Gabbi opens her eyes, her heart pounding in her chest. The witch is holding the baby's severed head in one hand and the bloody knife in the other. She cackles again and licks the blood off of the blade. Gabbi turn and runs back the way she came, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows that she has just delivered a baby to a monster, and she will never forget the look on the witch's face.
