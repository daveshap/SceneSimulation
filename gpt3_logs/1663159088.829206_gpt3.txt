SCENE: The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in a beautiful array of oranges and pinks. The waves were gentle and soothing, crashing against the shore. Bob took a deep breath in, filling his lungs with the salty air. It was going to be a beautiful day. He walked down the beach, admiring the view. He spotted a few people further down, walking their dogs or jogging. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the peace and quiet of the morning. Suddenly, Bob heard a loud scream. He turned around and saw a woman running towards him, her face panicked. She was hysterical, and it took him a moment to understand what she was saying. "Help! There's a man with a knife! He's going to kill me!" Bob's heart raced as he realized what was happening. He quickly looked around, but didn't see anyone. The woman was still running towards him, and he could see the terror in her eyes. He didn't know what to do. Should he run away? Hide? He didn't have time to make a decision. The next thing he knew, he was on the ground, gasping for air. He couldn't believe it. He'd been stabbed. He felt the warm blood running down his side and knew he was in trouble. The woman was still screaming, and he could hear the sound of footsteps running away. Bob tried to get up, but his body was weak and he couldn't move. He lay there, helpless, as the footsteps faded into the distance.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Bob's vision started to blur and he could feel himself slipping away. He could hear the woman still screaming, but it sounded distant now. He tried to summon the strength to get up, but his body was unresponsive. He could feel the warm blood still flowing from his wound, and he knew he was in serious trouble. He tried to cry out for help, but his voice was weak and barely audible. He could hear the sound of footsteps running away, getting softer and softer until they faded into the distance. And then everything went black.
