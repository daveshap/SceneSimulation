Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: Swathi is standing on the surface of the moon, gazing up at the stars. She feels a sense of wonder and awe at the sight of the vast expanse of space above her. She is also excited and proud to be standing on the moon, as it is a place that few humans have ever had the chance to visit. The air is thin and cold, and Swathi can feel the harshness of the environment. She is wearing a space suit to protect her from the hostile conditions. She is standing near the site where her team has been working to build a new lunar base. The base is not yet completed, but Swathi and her team have made great progress. She looks around at the barren landscape, imagining what it will be like when the base is finished. She is excited to be a part of this historic project.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

Swathi looks up at the stars for a few more moments, taking in the sight of the infinite expanse of space. She then turns her attention back to the lunar base, and begins walking towards it. As she approaches, she can see her team working on various parts of the base. Some are working on the foundation, others are putting up walls, and still others are working on the roof. Swathi is impressed by the progress they have made in such a short amount of time. She walks into the base, and is greeted by her team. They are all excited to see her, and ask her about her experience on the surface of the moon. Swathi tells them all about her experience, and how amazed she was by the sight of the stars. She also tells them about her excitement for the project, and how proud she is to be a part of it. They all share in her excitement, and are eager to continue working on the base.
