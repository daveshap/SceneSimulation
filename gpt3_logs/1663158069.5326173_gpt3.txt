Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: The sun is setting behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the cottage. Gabbi is sitting on the porch, watching the children play in the yard. They are laughing and chasing each other around, and she can't help but smile. It's been a long day, but Gabbi doesn't mind. She loves spending time with the kids. They always make her laugh and she enjoys seeing them happy. Eventually, the children start to get tired and they come to sit with Gabbi on the porch. They chat for a while about their day, and then it's time for bed. Gabbi tucks them in and gives them each a goodnight kiss. She lingers in the hallway for a moment, listening to their soft breathing as they drift off to sleep. Then she quietly closes the door and heads back to the porch. She sits down and looks up at the stars, taking a moment to relax before heading home.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The sun has almost set by the time Gabbi finishes tucking the kids into bed. She takes a moment to listen to their soft breathing, enjoying the peace of the moment. Eventually, she heads back to the porch, where she finds herself drawn to the stars. She gazes up at them for a while, letting her mind wander. She thinks about the world beyond her little cottage and all the possibilities that exist out there. Maybe one day she'll get to see some of those places for herself. For now, though, she's content to sit on her porch and enjoy the quiet of the night.
