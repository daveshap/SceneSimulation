Given the following SCENE, write the NEXT SCENE. Use your imagination to describe the following scene and setting in great detail. We want to see a play-by-play of what's going on in this environment. The NEXT SCENE should be just as long and detailed as the original.

SCENE: It's a peaceful country cottage in the middle of the night. Wang, a delivery driver, is making his rounds when he notices something strange. He can't quite put his finger on it, but something seems off. He cautiously approaches the cottage and peers in through the window. Inside, he sees a woman lying on the floor, unmoving. He knows he needs to act fast. He kicks down the door and rushes to her side. She's still breathing, but she's unresponsive. Wang calls 911 and stays with her until the ambulance arrives. It's a scary moment, but Wang is glad he was able to help.

LONG DETAILED NEXT SCENE:

==========

The ambulance arrives within minutes, and Wang steps aside to let the paramedics in. They quickly assess the situation and load the woman onto a stretcher. Wang watches as they hurry her out to the ambulance and load her inside. The doors close and the ambulance speeds away, sirens blaring. Wang is shaken up by the whole ordeal. He's never seen anything like that before. He knows he did the right thing by stepping in and calling for help, but he can't help but feel a little uneasy. He finishes his delivery and heads back to the truck. It's been a long night, and he's ready to go home.
