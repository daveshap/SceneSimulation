I nearly ate some earlier, but I was lucky enough to remember in time. We need to find something else to eat.\" Bob's heart sinks. He had been so close to food, but now they are back to square one. He looks around desperately, trying to think of what to do. Then he sees a small stream not far from them and has an idea. \"If we follow that stream, it might lead us to a lake or a river. And if we're lucky, we might find something to eat there.\" The woman agrees and they start following the stream. After a while, they come to a clearing and Bob's heart leaps with joy when he sees a small lake in front of them.
