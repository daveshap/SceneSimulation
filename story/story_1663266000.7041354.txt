Sylas walked through the forest, his heart pounding in his chest. He was not sure where he was going, but he knew that he had to keep going. He could hear the sound of the dragons in the distance, and he knew that he had to find them. He walked for what felt like hours, until he finally came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a tower, and Sylas could see a light shining from the window. He knew that this was where the dragons lived. He took a deep breath and stepped into the clearing. As he did, the light in the window went out. Sylas could see the dragons moving around in the tower, and he knew that he had to confront them. He took a step forward, and the ground started to shake. The dragons were coming down to meet him. Sylas was not afraid, for he knew that he was the chosen one.
